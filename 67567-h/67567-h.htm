<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Old Sutro and young
Steenie were where
they might have
been found on almost
every day at
the same hour,&mdash;down
on the beach,
where the great
cañon cut through
the <i>mesa</i> to the
sea.</p>

<p>A group of
rocks, roughly
piled, and a
few evergreen shrubs clustering about them,
made a pleasant break in a long, monotonous
stretch of coast, and the coolness of the spot
was always refreshing after their canter in
the sunshine. Their horses had been unsaddled
and set free to browse upon the herbage up the
cañon; and these moved here and there, lazily,
as if&mdash;like the old <i>caballero</i> himself&mdash;they felt
the languor of that midday hour.</p>

<p>“Sutro, what makes the water so bluey-green?”
asked the little girl, who had been sitting silent
for full one minute and gazing dreamily at the
shining waves.</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> How can I tell?”</p>

<p>“But you should know, shouldn’t you?
Doesn’t everybody keep learning things all the
time? If I were a’most a hundred, like you,
I should know everything, I think. In verity,
I should be able to answer a simple question such
as that. And so I tell you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> Thou wouldst find thou knew nothing at
all, maybe; and thou wouldst not trouble if it were
so. Because, if the good <i>Dios</i> wished to make us
wise He would put wisdom into our heads without
labor to us, wouldn’t he? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Fie, my Sutro! Do I learn reading that way?
But no. I should wait a long time first, my
father says. Well, then, if you do not know
what makes the water green, I s’pose, at least,
you can tell what lies beyond the water?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that I can! Beyond the water lies the
sky. Thou canst see that for thyself,” answered
the old man, with a chuckle of delight, and pointing
to the horizon, where, in truth, the sky and
ocean seemed to blend.</p>

<p>“No, that is a mistake, begging your pardon,
dear Sutro, though it looks so. For my father
says that it is only seeming; and that if I were
to sail ’way, ’way over ever so far, it would be
just as it is here,&mdash;the water so low down and
the sky so high up above my reach. But, dearie
me, I s’pose you will never tell me anything,
Sutro! I must find out all things for myself.
I wish my father wasn’t so busy. I wish my
mother hadn’t died when I was a baby. I
wish I knew what makes the road-runners such
silly birds. Why should they keep always in
front of one in a chase after them? Why don’t
they fly up out of the way? But, of course, you
can’t tell. And I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;What makes
people grow wrinkley when they get old? You
can’t help being wrinkley, I know that, dear
Sutro, but what makes it?”</p>

<p>“<i>En verdad!</i> It may be answering thy idle
questions, Little Un; yet there is one thing I
would have thee know, and remember it. My
soul! if thou dost not, I will be&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not angry, please, Sutro!” cried Steenie, in
sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“Maybe no. Not angry, truly. But wilt thou
remember? I cannot be a hundred till the
<i>Natividad</i> (Christmas) comes round five-and-ten
times more. When I am a hundred years, thou
wilt be a woman. This I know, because I asked
Father Antonio when I was last at his house.
My father was a hundred and ten when he died;
and his father even more than that. The Vives’
family lives long in this world, and&mdash;<i>Guay!</i>
wouldst thou lie down without thy blanket?”</p>

<p>For Steenie had thrown herself full length on
the mass of sea-pink vines, and would have been
asleep in another moment; but kind old Sutro
spread his gay Navajo blanket further up, under
the shelter of the rocks, and, after the child had
curled herself upon it, arranged with utmost care
the branches of the chaparral till she was wholly
screened from sunlight. Next, he whistled for
the horses, who came obediently back to the
mouth of the cañon; and then he went speedily
to sleep, as Steenie had done. But for himself
he made no screen, save his arm across his eyes,
nor any bed softer than the warm sand.</p>

<p>During the next half hour these two odd comrades
slumbered so peacefully that the teal in
the pool beyond the rocks, and the sand-pipers in
the rushes, went on about their business as fearlessly
as if no human intruders were near; but
when the half-hour was up, the girl awoke as
suddenly as she had slept. Sitting on her blanket,
she pushed her brown curls from her blue
eyes, and looked mischievously around at old
Sutro, whom she began to pelt with the crimson-rayed
pinks, aiming so deftly that one gold-hearted
blossom landed plump in the open mouth
of the sleeper. “<i>Hola! hola!</i> that was well
sent!” shouted she.</p>

<p>Sputtering the flower from his lips, the Spaniard
retorted, “In verity, I&mdash;”</p>

<p>But if he meant to scold his darling he was
not allowed; for she leaned over him, patted his
brown cheeks, and kissed him squarely on the
forehead, in the very thickest tangle of the wrinkles
she so disliked. “There, there, that will
do, Señor Sutro Vives! If I was rude, you
will forgive me; and if I hurt you, the wound
will heal.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast healed it already, Little Un, and
hast gladdened the heart of thy slave!” answered
the other, with the extravagance of expression to
which his tongue was prone.</p>

<p>“Pooh, my Sutro, you my slave,&mdash;the proudest
of proud on all Santa Felisa ranch! My
father says that the blood of three races runs
in your veins, and that you have kept the best
part of each. What does he mean by that? I
heard him talking thus, once, with some strangers,
who came to see the place. It was when
you rode away on Mazan´, there; and one of the
gentlemen said you were a very picture-y, or
something, kind of a man, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pardons, Little Un, but it is
false!”</p>

<p>“Why, Sutro, what do you mean? Isn’t it
fine to be picture-y? I’m sure the stranger
thought so, for he noticed everything about you,&mdash;your
buckskin leggings, your sombrero, your
big saddle, your lariat, and all. He said you
were a most int’resting kind of a ‘type,’ and an
‘old Californian,’ and so on. I didn’t like the
‘old’ part of the talk, though, ’cause if you
have to be called old, I’d rather do it myself,
wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>Sutro vouchsafed no reply. His brow had
grown moody, and his movements betokened
anger; for he picked up the blanket, and folded
it with unusual precision, and, if it were possible,
threw his shoulders back more squarely than
ever. At that moment, from the snap of his
black eyes and the rigidity of his upright figure,
he might have been eighteen instead of eighty-five,
which was the number of years Father
Antonio’s reckoning accorded him.</p>

<p>Steenie became silent, for the one thing she
feared was anger; but when the <i>caballero</i> whistled
for Mazan´, she puckered her own red lips
into a summons for Tito, who answered by a loving
neigh and an immediate approach.</p>

<p>Not so the brown mare, Mazan´, to whose sensitive
ears Sutro’s whistle had conveyed the information
that her master was cross; and when
that was the case, it were well that all tender-hearted
creatures kept out of his way. So, instead
of trotting forward to be mounted, pretty
Mazan´ trotted off up the beach, and at a distance
of a few rods broke into a wild gallop toward
home.</p>

<p>Then Steenie laughed; she couldn’t help it,
though she trembled instantly, fearing she had
made matters worse.</p>

<p>But no. There was something so merry and
infectious about that laugh that doting old Sutro
was not the one to withstand its influence; his
frown relaxed to a smile. “Well, well, <i>En
verdad!</i> Mazan´ knows something after all! For
she would be a foolish thing to come back for a
beating she did not deserve, would she not, <i>mi
niña</i> [my little one]?”</p>

<p>“So I should think, indeed! But what fun!
You shall mount with me, and we will chase her.
She’ll not stop to think that Tito can run her
two to one, will she?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” assented the <i>caballero</i>, vaulting up
behind his young favorite, and making ready for
use the lariat which had been wound around his
waist while he rested; also, for once, accepting
without challenge Steenie’s declaration that Tito
was the fleeter animal.</p>

<p>Such a race as that was! Save themselves
and the fleeing mare, not a moving thing was in
sight; for, leaving the <i>mesa</i> bluff and the cañon,
they left also the teal and the sand-pipers and
the few creeping creatures which lived in the
chaparral. To the west glittered the rich-hued
Pacific Ocean; before them and behind them lay
miles and miles of yellow beach, while far eastward
towered the mountains which formed the
boundary of the great Santa Felisa rancho.</p>

<p>Lonely? Why, yes, it may have been; but so
free, so roomy, and so sunny, that these two who
darted athwart the picture never thought of loneliness.
Besides, why should they? Santa Felisa
was home to them; and during the few short
years that Steenie Calthorp had lived she had
viewed just such wide stretches of this lovely
world, and no other; for a city, or even town,
she had never seen.</p>

<p>As they rode they talked,&mdash;the girl asking
and her attendant parrying questions without
number, till he cried out, impatiently, “If thou
wilt chatter always, Little Un, how can Tito win
the race? Be quiet now, for just two minutes,
and my lady Mazan´ shall feel the rope about her
throat, if Sutro’s hand has not lost its cunning,
with all this tiresome talk of ‘old,’ ‘old’!”</p>

<p>“<i>Ce, ce, ce!</i>” echoed Steenie, softly, in her
eagerness using the familiar Spanish injunction
to silence, and bending low to whisper a few
encouraging words in Tito’s ear. Like an arrow
he shot forward, and in a brief space had gained
so close to Mazan´ that Sutro made ready to
throw.</p>

<p>“Whiz-z! Swish!” The rope had cut the air
in shining circles above the runaway’s straining
head, and descended with unerring exactness to
her steaming neck; who, at the first touch of the
cord, understood its meaning, and stood stock-still,&mdash;a
throbbing, beautiful, but wholly conquered
thing.</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> Señ’rita Mazan´! Wouldst serve
thy master so? Take that&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the uplifted hand was stayed, as suddenly
as the mare’s flight had been, by Steenie’s clutch
of Sutro’s wrist, and her rebuke: “What! would
you strike her, really,&mdash;Mazan´, who never knew
stroke or blow! Or has this been your habit, and
I s’posing you so gentle! For shame to you,
Sutro Vives! and shame ten thousand times!
What is she but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A vixen! so I tell thee, who must be broken
of her evil tricks. <i>Caramba!</i> Thus I will have
it. ‘Women and mares and a spaniel dog&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Sutro! Leave your dirty Spanish jabbering,
and listen to me. If you strike her you shall not
ride on the beach&mdash;for&mdash;one&mdash;whole&mdash;week!
And ‘so I tell thee’! I will take&mdash;let me see&mdash;maybe
Nicoloso Barbazon, instead.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> but thou wilt not, Little Un! What does
the stupid Nicoloso know of what a señorita’s
body-servant should be? Answer me that. <i>Caramba!</i>”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, my Sutro! Somebody is silly still;
but it isn’t Mazan´, nor Tito, nor me! And you
make me think you are not well: you are so
very, very cross. Never mind, poor thing! Get
upon your pretty beast, who stands so quiet now,
and let us go on. I am as hungry as hungry;
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;Nicoloso?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! for Nicoloso! He needn’t come if you
are good, need he? Sutro, what makes one so
uncomf’table to be hungry? If it weren’t for that
queerness inside of me I could stay out all day,
and maybe all night.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pardons, Señ’rita, but thou
couldst not. What would thy father do if dinner
came but not his little daughter?”</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;what could he? He couldn’t live
without me, could he? And there’s the house.
Another race, ’tween Tito and Mazan´ this time,
not Tito catching her. To the house. I’ll beat
you, my Sutro!”</p>

<p>They struck into it briskly; but, as they neared
the goal, both riders slackened pace at sight of a
strange carriage standing before the ranch-house
door, with several of the household servants
grouped excitedly about it.</p>

<p>“More strangers!” cried Steenie, regretfully.
“It is nothing but comp’ny all the time, nowadays;
and I get no more nice times with papa,
because he must always attend to them. I wish
they wouldn’t come; don’t you, Sutro?”</p>

<p>But she received no answer; for the old <i>caballero</i>
had muttered two words, “The master!” then had
dashed around the building toward the kitchen court.</p>

<p>“The master? Who can he be? Isn’t my
father the master? Except, of course, that great
rich lord who owns Santa Felisa, and never comes
near it at all,&mdash;not once in all my life, my father
says; and I’m sure I hope he hasn’t now, for I
should be dreadfully afraid of a lord who wore a
gold cornet on his head, as Suzan´ says ‘every
lord does who is any ’count at all.’”</p>

<p>But he had indeed come; and the little girl,
who had trotted slowly up to the verandah, was
lifted from her saddle, and duly presented by her
father, the manager, to a stout, red-faced old
gentleman as, “My Lord, my daughter.”</p>

<p>“So? Hm-m. Let me see. Wife died. Only
one? So, so. Nice child. Run along, Sissy.
Hm-m. I’d like dinner now. Great country for
appetite&mdash;California. Afterward, business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp bowed gravely and respectfully;
and, loosing Steenie’s hand, bade her make herself
ready for the table as soon as possible. She held
up her face for a kiss, then sped away, thinking
she had never seen her father look so serious, and
wondering why. “Was he afraid of a lord, too?
And was the cor’net under the man’s hat?”</p>

<p>Customs were simple at Santa Felisa; for, till
now, the household had been practically that of
the manager alone, and, in default of an older
person, Daniel Calthorp had liked to have his little
daughter preside at table. So it seemed strange
to none but Lord Plunkett himself when, a little
later than usual, she entered the dining-room and
took her usual place. Feeling she must honor
such a wonderful occasion, she had taken uncommon
pains with her toilet; and, fortunately, the
guest was too indifferent to such matters to be
shocked by the rather striking combination of a
red sash, a blue throat-knot against the white
frock, and a mass of reddish-brown curls bound
into a stiff little knot by a band of green velvet.</p>

<p>Sutro followed her. As the oldest resident of
the rancho, he felt that he fully understood the
requirements of the hour; and he had also hastily
arrayed himself in his gayest apparel, to take his
place solemnly behind his little “señorita’s”
chair. There he stood, perfectly motionless, apparently
not noticing anybody,&mdash;even Steenie
herself,&mdash;and reminding the amused Lord Plunkett
of nothing in the world save one of the wooden
figures outside a tobacconist’s shop.</p>

<p>A Chinese waiter, instructed and assisted by the
valet, Dorsey, served the unexpected guest, and
the housemaid attended to the others. But nobody
ate very much except the stranger; for Mr.
Calthorp was too busy answering his lordship’s
questions, and Steenie too curiously regarding his
lordship’s appearance.</p>

<p>Suddenly that gentleman looked up. “Well,
Sissy! What d’ye think? Seem to be staring
sharp. Children read folks. Hope you’ll like
me. Fond of children. If they don’t talk. You
don’t talk. Look as if you wished to. Out with
it! Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I’m not afraid, now. Ought I to be?
But, will you please tell me where you keep it?
And why don’t you wear it?”</p>

<p>“Eh? How? Keep it? Wear it? What?”</p>

<p>“Your cor’net. Suzan´ says you can’t be a real
lord, ’n’ess you have one.”</p>

<p>“Steenie!” reproved Mr. Calthorp, smiling in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Good. Good. Let her alone. Hm-m. Coronet.
Suzan´ ought to know. Well. Didn’t bring it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” In a tone of deep regret.</p>

<p>“No. Sorry now. If I’d imagined disappointment&mdash;might.
But&mdash;inconvenient. Don’t wear
it often.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Steenie again, surprised by the
twinkle in the nobleman’s eyes. “I didn’t know.
I s’posed you had to. But I should think it would
be uncomf’table; ’cause gold is so heavy, and your
head so smooth and shiny. I s’pose it would slip
off.”</p>

<p>His lordship’s manners certainly were peculiar.
He nearly choked himself trying to suppress a
laugh and to eat at the same time; but finally
yielded to a real guffaw, as noisily as any cow-boy
on the <i>hacienda</i>.</p>

<p>“Steenie!” said the manager once more, this
time with real severity, and comprehending for
the first time how sadly neglected the child had
been.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, Lord Plunkett was very good-natured,
and wisely divined that his small new
acquaintance was rude from ignorance, not
intention. Dinner over, he made friends with
her directly, and explained away the mistaken
notions with which the housemaid had filled her
head; while Steenie listened eagerly, delighted to
find at last somebody who had both leisure and
patience to answer “foolish questions.”</p>

<p>Lord Plunkett did this without waste of words;
and at the same time went poking about the
place, enjoying the novelty of all he saw, and
gaining from Steenie’s talk a pretty fair idea of
the daily life at San’ Felisa. “Hm-m. So I see.
Brought yourself up, my dear. No mother. Father
busy. Servants ignorant. No church. No
school. Well, well. Good thing for you, bad for
me. Pity about his eyes. Bad, bad. Hope he
won’t be blind. Permanently.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too; though I don’t know who you
mean,” said the little girl, sweetly.</p>

<p>“Good child. But&mdash;don’t know? Why&mdash;father.
Your father, of course. Hope he’s the
only one losing eyesight and going away. Hate
new men. Old ones invaluable. Hope he’ll get
better. Come back. Bad country for eyes. Too
much sunshine. Not enough green.”</p>

<p>Steenie stopped short on the path. “What
was that, sir, please? My&mdash;father&mdash;blind?
My father&mdash;going away? Oh, dear Lordship,
is that what you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes. Certainly. What? Not know it?
Why else should I come? Hm-m. Queer. Starts
in few days. Operation&mdash;maybe cure&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he did not finish his sentence; for the child
had suddenly darted away from him, and to the
side of the “tobacconist’s sign,” who was crossing
the court at that moment. “Sutro! O my Sutro!
My father is blind&mdash;and&mdash;going&mdash;away!”</p>

<p>“It is false!” cried the old Spaniard, with his
ready and angry defiance of all things unpleasant.</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;it is true! ’Cause the cor’net man
said so!” And clinging to her ancient playfellow,
Steenie buried her face in his blanket, and sobbed
bitterly.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">There, she’s
found it out!
And it’s a deal
worse than if her
papa had told
her first off!” said Suzan´,
at the kitchen door. “I
never saw Miss Steenie cry
about anything before, and
I wish now that I’d a
broke it to her myself.”</p>

<p>“My, my! the poor
lamb!” echoed Ellen, the
cook, joining the housemaid.
“No, she haint
never been one fer cryin’,&mdash;not
even fer bumps er scratches. Sunshiny’s
what she’s been, an’ so I say. Does seem’s if I
couldn’t stay to cook fer no new manager’s folks
after that sweet angel. Good mind ter give notice
myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait! Maybe it won’t be so bad as we
think. Master don’t look blind.”</p>

<p>“How can ye tell how he looks, ’hind them
great goggles o’ his’n? I guess it’s bad as it
can be, er he wouldn’t give in to it. He’s clear
grit, an’ so I say. That’s where Miss Steenie
gets her’n. See! she’s spied her father comin’
back from the valley! He rid away to call the
boys together, ’cause his lordship wants to see
’em, I suppose. Well, he’s right peart-lookin’
yet; but man’s born to troubles, an’ he’ll hev
to take his share.”</p>

<p>The women watched Steenie run with outstretched
arms to meet Mr. Calthorp; saw him
check his horse suddenly, when he had almost
ridden her down, and bend low to lift her to his
saddle. They saw the child’s arms clasp close
about his neck, and fancied they could hear her
wild outburst of grief. Then, with moistened
eyes, but in true delicacy, they turned away from
witnessing a child’s first sorrow.</p>

<p>“Papa, is it true?”</p>

<p>“My darling, why do you cry? What true?”
The well-trained horse stood still while the rider
folded his little daughter close to his own heavy
heart.</p>

<p>“About your eyes. Are you&mdash;blind?”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp shivered. Even to himself he
could not yet acknowledge what seemed so plain
to almost everybody else. “No, sweetheart, I
am not blind&mdash;yet; but for a long, long time
there has been something wrong with my eyes,
and I dare put off no further the treatment
which they require. So I wrote to Lord Plunkett
and asked him to relieve me of my duties
here, and I meant to tell you as soon as it seemed
necessary. He came before I had expected that
he could. He wishes to make a thorough examination
of all Santa Felisa affairs, and to be fully
informed concerning what has and has not been
accomplished. I was glad, yet sorry, to see him;
for our going away means leaving what has been
my home for many years, and the only one you
have ever known.” He continued talking for
some time, till he had given a very quiet and
clear explanation, which soothed the excited
child; besides, the words “not blind&mdash;yet”
were quite enough to fill her buoyant heart
with a hope that seemed certainty.</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am! And I s’pose the lordship
didn’t understand. I’m quite&mdash;quite sure
he didn’t mean to tell a wrong story, and I’m
sorry I snatched my hand away from him. I’ll
go and ’xplain it now, if you will put me down,
Papa, dear!”</p>

<p>Smiling, Mr. Calthorp complied; and chirruping
to his horse, continued his course stableward,
while Steenie sought the “cor’net man” to make
her naïve apology.</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t behave very p’lite, Mr. Plunkett,
but I hope you won’t be angry; I don’t
like folks to be angry; but you see I didn’t
think of anything ’cept my father,&mdash;not then.
And I want to ’xplain it,&mdash;he isn’t blind&mdash;yet;
and he’s going to see a treatment; so he’ll
prob’ly get them fixed over all right. And if
there’s anything I can do to int’rest you I will;
for I like you very much.”</p>

<p>“Eh?&mdash;So?&mdash;Thank you. I like you, too.
Bright&mdash;bonny&mdash;worth a fortune. Hm-m!
Better than coronets. Stick to it. Sit down?
Orange-tree, yonder. Now, then, talk.”</p>

<p>Laughing at his mirthful manner and odd sentences,
Steenie led her new friend to the seat he
designated; and folding her hands in her lap,
said politely: “I’ll talk what more I know.
’Tisn’t much, I guess; only ’bout horses; I
haven’t told you ’bout them yet, have I?”</p>

<p>“No. Horses? What? Whose? Go on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ours!&mdash;No, yours, I s’pose they are.
Maybe they’re the ‘boys.’ We’ve trained them
beautifully. Tomaso and Connecticut Jim both
say it can’t be beat. It’s great fun!”</p>

<p>“Don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“No, I s’pose not. But&mdash;this way, like a
‘circus,’ my father says. They’s thirty-three, all
counted; and every man of us has tried to teach
our horse something better ’n each other; and
they’re just too cunning for anything! Bob’s
kept the ‘cup’ for ever so long now; but I’m
going to win it away from him some time,&mdash;see
if I don’t! Oh, I forgot!” The eager little
face suddenly drooped at memory of that terrible
“going away,” which would be even earlier than
the anticipated “some time.”</p>

<p>“Why, why!&mdash;delightful! Never heard anything
like it! See it, can I,&mdash;eh?” demanded
his lordship, whose love for horses was very
great.</p>

<p>“I hope&mdash;I s’pose so. I don’t know. Kentucky
Bob’s the head of us. We all have to
mind him; and sometimes he don’t be very
pleasant. But he’s very nice and honest, my
father says; and I love him dearly. Then we
can’t have a ‘circus’ till he gets over it again.
My father says, too, it’s ’cause he has a ‘crank’
in him somewhere. I s’pose that’s what hurts
him and makes him unpleasant. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Bad complaint; quite general;
touch myself. No, don’t go! All right to-day.
But&mdash;where’s Kentucky Bob? Walk him out!
Won’t refuse,&mdash;not me.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t s’pose he would, on ’count of
your being a lordship. If you don’t mind staying
alone, I’ll run and ask him. I saw him cross
the <i>arroyo</i> just a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Trot; but come back.”</p>

<p>Steenie departed; and while she was gone
Mr. Calthorp walked gropingly toward the bench
where his employer sat. He could still see sufficiently
to guide himself about, and his knowledge
of places and voices aided him. His eyes
were screened by close-fitting goggles of dark
glass; but he had worn these so long that
Steenie had almost forgotten how he had ever
looked without them. Few men in his condition
would have held to his post as long as he had
done, nor was this course wise in him; but he
was not a rich man, and he had been anxious to
earn and save what he could for his little daughter’s
sake.</p>

<p>“Hm-m! Get around&mdash;first-rate. Little
girl’s smart; like her.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. She is, indeed, a brave, sunny
child. In some ways her leaving Santa Felisa
will be better for her. She should go to school
and mingle with women. Here she has no company
but myself and the ‘boys.’ Old Sutro has
devoted himself to her since her infancy, and
loves her jealously. Indeed, they all love her;
but that is not strange, for she loves them. Has
she gone upon an errand for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Kentucky Bob. Circus; like to see it.
Says maybe he won’t; ‘crank.’”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;he is&mdash;very peculiar. However, he
has a wonderful gift with horses; it seems almost
like magic; and he has imparted much of his
skill to Steenie. She is perfectly fearless. But
I won’t anticipate. Are they coming?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Hm-m! how old&mdash;she?”</p>

<p>“Ten years. I’ll leave her to negotiate matters.”</p>

<p>Steenie approached the orange-tree, leading by
one hand a great fellow, whose face at that moment
wore its most forbidding expression, and
who seemed inclined to break away from his
small guide; yet determined, in his own words,
“to bluff her out.” Catch him, a free-born American,
truckling to anybody, even if that body were
a genuine “lord,” and, what was more, his own
employer! He guessed he wasn’t a going to get
up no shows unless he wanted to! And he evidently
did not so incline.</p>

<p>However, when he came quite near, and saw
the small, dumpy, red-faced old gentleman sitting
beside Mr. Calthorp, his astonishment conquered
every other sentiment. He a lord! Whe-ew! he
might be anybody! and of no great account
either. Plain suit of clothes, no rings, no
watch-chain, no scarf-pin even; bald-headed,
good-natured, sensible. As his observations
reached this happy climax, Bob ceased tugging
at his feminine guiding-string, and marched
frankly forward. Her father could not see the
action; but Steenie was amazed when the refractory
ranchman doffed his hat and made a
respectful, if somewhat awkward, bow. She
had never witnessed such a concession before
on his part.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, sir; hope I see you well.”</p>

<p>“Quite, thank you. Hear you’re wonderful.
Horses. Like to see, if suits.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’d like to ’blige; but, you see, it’s
against the rules. Once a week, an’ no oftener,
is what we agreed. No use o’ rules if you
don’t stick to ’em. Exercise every Sunday; no
other times in public. If I ’lowed the ‘boys’ to
go it rash, say on odd days, they’d get the upper
hand in no time; then where’d I be?”</p>

<p>From the tone of his voice, Mr. Calthorp judged
that Bob “wanted coaxing;” but this was not his
affair. From the moment of Lord Plunkett’s
arrival he had practically resigned all authority,
so he did not interfere.</p>

<p>Now, my lord was, as has been said, very good-natured;
but, like many other good-natured
and unassuming people, opposition, or imposition,
made him a little testy. Moreover, he was accustomed
to command, not to sue; and he considered
that he had already conceded as much as was
necessary to this rough specimen of American
manhood. His choler and color rose together;
and he opened his lips with a very decided and
undignified snort: “Woo-oo! Eh? Hey?”</p>

<p>But, fortunately for all parties, Steenie’s bright
eyes had telegraphed alarm to her loving heart;
and with a quick little “’Xcuse me!” she pulled
Bob’s surly face to the level of her lips, and whispered
something in his ear.</p>

<p>Then, as if there had been a spring in his back,
his head rebounded to the upright, his cheek
actually paled beneath its tan, and he ejaculated
fiercely, “Great&mdash;Huckleberries!”</p>

<p>It was the nearest approach to an oath which
this strange man ever allowed himself; for,
though he thought nothing of breaking the Sabbath
by racing or gaming, he neither gave way
to profanity nor indulged himself with a drop of
spirituous liquor. He used to describe himself as
“half marm, half pop;” and to attribute his
sobriety and general uprightness to the “marm”
side, all to the contrary, “pop.” Years before,
when, a hot-tempered lad, he had run away from
“pop’s” wrath, he had solemnly promised his
weeping “marm” that he would “never drink
nor swear;” and, to the honor of Kentucky Bob,
be it said that he had loyally kept his word.</p>

<p>“Huckleberries! Little Un, you don’t mean
it! You wouldn’t, would you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ve got to, dear old Bob! But&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;I
won’t cry! I will not. And
you’ll do it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I reckon! But&mdash;little missy&mdash;the
boys won’t believe it. An’&mdash;Say, Boss, is it
true? Are you a goin’ to light out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob,” answered Mr. Calthorp, sadly;
“but from necessity, not choice.”</p>

<p>“An’ the Little Un&mdash;why must she go? Ain’t
nothin’ the matter of her eyes, is they?”</p>

<p>“No, no; thank God!”</p>

<p>“Well, then; leave her here. We’ll take care
of her. Square. Why&mdash;what&mdash;in huckleberries&mdash;’ll
San’ Felis’ be ’ithout our little missy?
Ain’t she lived here ever sence she was borned?
Ain’t we be’n good to her? We’re rough, we be.
We ain’t no lords, ner nothin’ but jest cow-boys
er sech. But we’re men. An’ Americans. An’ I
’low there ain’t one of us but would fight till
he died fer the Little Un, afore harm should
tetch her. No! It mustn’t be. An’ that’s
square.”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Calthorp, who had had abundant
proof, heretofore, of the “boys’” devotion to
Steenie, was surprised at the depth of feeling betrayed
by Bob’s words; for he could not fully
know all that the child had been to these men,
separated, as most of them were, from home and
its associations. Since the hour when they had
been permitted to carry or amuse her, a tiny baby
in long clothes, they had adopted her in their
hearts, each in his own way finding in the frank,
merry, friendly little creature an embodiment of
his own better nature. They had even, with the
superstition of their class, accepted her as their
“mascot,” sincerely believing that every enterprise
to which she lent her presence or approval
was sure to prosper.</p>

<p>To what other human being would Kentucky
Bob have imparted the secret of his wonderful
power over the equine race? Indeed, to none
other; and to her only because he loved her
so, and was so proud of her cleverness. And
now his big, honest heart ached with a new
and bitter pain, as he faced the danger of her
loss.</p>

<p>“Why, Robert! Why! Eh, what? Tut, tut.
Good child. Understand. But&mdash;father. First
claim. See?”</p>

<p>Angry Bob cast one scorching, contemptuous
glance upon the nervous little lord; and if looks
could annihilate, the British peerage would then
and there have been short one member. Stooping,
he swung Steenie to his shoulder, and strode
away toward the great group of out-buildings
which made the home-piece of Santa Felisa rancho
seem like a village in itself. In the thickest crowd
of the employees who had been summoned to meet
their newly-arrived employer he came to a sudden
halt.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob! What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;The&mdash;I wish to sizzle! Sho, I can’t talk.
Tell ’em, Little Un.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob,” answered Steenie, gently, patting
the great head around which she clung for support.
“But s’pose you put me down. I’m heavy.
I’m such a big girl, now.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t. Hold you forever, if you’ll
stay.”</p>

<p>“Stay? stay where?” asked somebody.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em,” again commanded the Kentuckian;
and waving her hand, she hushed them by this
gesture to hear her words.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow, the words wouldn’t come. For
the second time that day the self-control of the
child failed to respond to her needs. Her eyes
roamed from face to face of those gathered about
her, and there was not one on which she did not
read an answering love for the great love she bore
to it. Rough faces, most of them. Sun blackened,&mdash;sin
blackened too, perhaps; but gentle,
every one, toward her. Odd comrades for a little
girl, and she a descendant of “one of the first
families in Old Knollsboro;” still the only comrades
she had ever known, and therefore she
craved no other.</p>

<p>Twice she tried to speak, and felt a queer lump
in her throat that choked her; and at last she
dropped her face upon Bob’s rough mane, her
sunny curls mingling with it to hide the tears
which hurt her pride to show.</p>

<p>An ominous growl ran round the assembly, and
the sound was the tonic she needed. “Hmm!
who’s a makin’ ther Little Un cry?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, boys! dear, dear boys! Not anybody
at all! I’m not crying now; see?” Proudly
her head was tossed back, and a determined smile
came to the still quivering lips, even while
the tears glistened on the long lashes. “You
see, it’s this way. I didn’t know it till this
very day that ever was, or I’d have told you.
’Cause I’ve always been square, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Square’s a brick!”</p>

<p>“But all the time my father’s been getting
blinder an’ blinder, an’ I didn’t even s’pect anything
’bout it. I thought he wore goggley things
’cause he liked ’em; but he didn’t: it was ’cause
he had to. And now, if he don’t go away quick,
he can’t get his poor eyes fixed up at all. So he
is. He’s going ’way, ’way off,&mdash;three thousand
miles, my father says, to a big city called New
York, where a lot of doctors live who don’t do
anything but mend eyes. My grandmother lives
in a little town close to New York, and we’re
going to her house to stay; and&mdash;and&mdash;that’s
all. I have to do it, you see. I’m sorry, ’cause
I love you all; but he’s my father, and I have
to love him the biggest, the best. And I hope
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no! Three cheers for the ‘boss’!”</p>

<p>Given with a will; and by the time the noise
had subsided, Steenie’s smile had become as bright
as ever, and that without any effort of her will.</p>

<p>“Good enough! Thank you, dears! And now
we’ll have an extra circus, won’t we? I’d like to
’blige Mr. Plunkett; and besides, you know, I&mdash;I
sha’n’t have you, nor the horses, nor any more
fun&mdash;in that old New York!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Little Un! Where’s your grit?”
asked Kentucky Bob, passing Steenie from his
shoulder to a convenient wagon-box.</p>

<p>His sudden change of tone astonished her.</p>

<p>“Hain’t I allays fetched ye up to do the square
thing? If your dooty calls you to N’ York,&mdash;to
N’ York you’ll have to go; but, fer the honor o’
San’ Felis’, an’ the credit o’ your boys, do it colors
flyin’&mdash;head up&mdash;shoulders back&mdash;right face&mdash;march!”</p>

<p>“I will, Bob! I will! I will!” cried Steenie,
impulsively. “You sha’n’t ever have to be ashamed
of your Little Un, and so I tell you!”</p>

<p>In the midst of the rousing cheers which followed,
Lord Plunkett appeared. He could restrain
his curiosity no longer.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">There was some
suspicion among
the other dwellers
at Santa Felisa
that Kentucky Bob
had once been employed
about a real
circus, else how had
he acquired that intimate
knowledge of the “rules and
regulations of the ring”
which he so constantly quoted
for their benefit or reproval?</p>

<p>Into this “ring” of theirs, the boxes, hurdles,
and other such things which the riders had been
accustomed to use were soon gathered, and the
labor of arranging these gave a wholly pleasant
diversion to their feelings. A card of invitation,
beautifully engrossed by a vaquero who had passed
from the halls of Harvard to the great solitudes
of the Sierras, was issued to Lord Plunkett, and
a seat of honor erected for him on the southern
side of the campus, while a spreading canvas wall
on the north was to serve as a screen for the preparatory
operations of the various actors.</p>

<p>Needless to say, maybe, that having once been
won over to the project of an “extra show,” an
enthusiastic determination was roused among the
Santa Felisans to make this farewell entertainment
of their beloved “mascot” eclipse everything
which had ever gone before.</p>

<p>Nor did the interest end at this ranch; for
mounted messengers were dispatched to invite
the people of the neighboring estates to be present
at the exhibition, and the invitations were
as generally as promptly accepted.</p>

<p>But, of course, all this preparation took time
to accomplish, so the hour had been appointed
for one o’clock of the following day; and during
the interval Steenie’s thoughts were so full of
the matter, her tongue so busy discussing it, that
she neither felt the time long nor permitted others
to do so.</p>

<p>Indeed, so affected was everybody by the pleasant
excitement of “getting ready,” that evening
came before Lord Plunkett and his manager were
finally seated with their books before them and
a secretary at hand, to examine into the business
which had brought them together. Even then
his lordship would gladly have waived the matter,
had he been allowed. “For ten years. No,
twelve. Ship-shape. Paid well. Prompt. What
more, eh? I’m satisfied. Why not you?”</p>

<p>“But, my lord, I cannot be. Any new manager
will have enough to learn, even without all
that I can do for him. It is a great responsibility;
and, my lord, I would respectfully suggest
that in the future you visit this part of your property
oftener than once in a dozen years.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m! maybe; don’t know. Planned to
stay a year now. Girl going away. Give it up.
Consider. She comes back; so ’ll I. Like her.
Credit to you; so’s the ranch.” Then the nobleman
looked up as Sutro entered, bringing the
“new manager’s” card. “Hello, Mexican! Well,
where? Indigestion? Missed you. Say you’ve
character? Born here? Eh? What?”</p>

<p>Sutro bowed profoundly, but a malicious grin
overspread his wrinkled face. “<i>En verdad!</i> Thy
Excellency honors his humble servant. Ten thousand
thanks. But the señor stranger is arrived.”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp rose and advanced carefully in
the direction of the door, extending his hand
toward the new-comer, whom he immediately
presented to Lord Plunkett; and, while these
gentlemen were exchanging civilities, he turned
sharply upon old Vives, whom he could hear
rustling about near him. “Where have you
been so long, Sutro? We have not seen you
since dinner. His lordship has inquired for you
several times.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> He does the least of his household too
great respect,” answered the Spaniard, with
haughty accent.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Sutro, don’t be foolish! It would
be wiser of you to conciliate both him and the
new ‘boss.’ They can easily turn you adrift, and
you are an old man. From the tone of your voice,
I judge that you are angry. That is senseless,
and I am sorry. I wish to feel that one as fond
of my little daughter as you are will be quite
happy and comfortable when we are gone.”</p>

<p>“I bow myself in obligation to thee, Señor
Calthorp,” responded the old Castilian, servilely.
But his mood was neither servile nor happy; and,
as the retiring manager turned once more toward
his successor, he sought the cozy corner of the
office which Steenie called her own, and where
she sat by her pretty shaded lamp, sorting her
picture-books.</p>

<p>“<i>Hola</i>, my Little Un! But I have put a thorn
in his shirt, no? Trust old Sutro!”</p>

<p>“How? What do you mean? And surely I
can trust you to do ’most anything hateful when
you look such a way! What have you done now,
Sutro Vives? Tell me that!”</p>

<p>“Hi, hi, hi! maybe no. <i>Si?</i> Dost thou wish
to go from San’ Felisa to the land of snow and
ice and no sunshine? Answer thou me that!”</p>

<p>“You know I don’t wish it; but I must, that
is all. But, wait, how do you happen to know
anything at all about it? You ran away directly
after dinner, and now you’ve just come in!”</p>

<p>“Pouf! thinkest thou an old caballero knows
nothing but what a baby tells him? I have
known for&mdash;this&mdash;long&mdash;time all that has
been planned for the little señ’rita. <i>Si! Lo dicho
dicho</i> [what I have said I have said].”</p>

<p>For a moment Steenie was silent, unable to
answer this argument. Then she cried triumphantly:
“But you need not tell me that. A
‘long time’ may be from this very mid-day that
ever was, but from no longer. Does anybody
at San’ Felis’ ever tell Sutro Vives secrets? In
verity, no; for Suzan´ says you are a sieve that
holds nothing. At the <i>Natividad</i>, poor dear
old caballero, with a word they don’t want
spoken? Why, nobody. And if you’d known
about my father’s eyes and all, you’d have told
me the very first minute! You would so, my
Sutro, you couldn’t have helped it!” clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>It was the señor’s turn to look crestfallen.
What his little lady declared against him was
quite true; but this had never prevented his
adopting an air of great mystery and secrecy
whenever the slightest occasion offered. Poor
old Sutro Vives was not the only one in this
world bigger in his own estimation than in that
of anybody else.</p>

<p>But he rallied as swiftly as she had done.
“<i>Tente!</i> what of that? He will not stay at San’
Felisa&mdash;yes? In verity, no; I have taken care
about that.”</p>

<p>“Sutro, you look, you truly do look, naughty!
What badness have you been doing now, señor?
Answer me that.”</p>

<p>“Is the truth badness? Then have I been
bad,” retorted the other, bridling. “I have told
him the truth, this not-wanted, unmannerly,
new director-manager. Thou belongest to us,&mdash;to
the vaqueros and caballeros, and everybody
who dwells at San’ Felisa. It is in thee the
‘good luck’ lives; and thou wilt never be allowed
to go away from us, so I tell thee! There will
be mutiny, uprising; what Connecticut Jim calls
‘strike.’ But go from Santa Felisa, thou? No!&mdash;a
thousand times <i>no</i>!”</p>

<p>Unperceived by them, Lord Plunkett had forsaken
the other table and the business talk, which
he found tiresome, for that of the pair in the cozy
corner, which appeared to be interesting; and he
had thrown himself upon a lounge which the back
of Steenie’s big chair hid from view, to play the
part of eavesdropper; only in this case it seemed
not ignoble, for the two animated disputants
spoke quite loudly enough to be heard by anybody
in the room who had chosen to listen. He
had, therefore, enjoyed the whole dialogue, and
he now leaned forward to watch Steenie’s bright
face and to catch her reply.</p>

<p>“But I answer you and Jim and everybody&mdash;yes!
Where my father goes I will go, and all
this silly talk won’t stop me! Next Saturday
morning, Sutro Vives, the noisy black engine
will stop at San’ Felisa station, and Papa Calthorp
and I will get into one of those big cars,
and will go whizz, away, away!&mdash;where you nor
Bob nor Jim nor nobody can do wicked, hateful
things to the Little Un, never again!”</p>

<p>Wrought up by the pathos of her own picture,
Steenie’s self-control gave way at this juncture,
and bounding toward her father, who seemed at
that moment to be a cruel enemy, and yet her
only friend, she astonished him by a torrent of
tears and embraces which effectually stopped all
further conversation.</p>

<p>“Sutro!” called Mr. Calthorp, sternly.</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>, señor; how can I serve thee?”</p>

<p>“Here, go with Miss Steenie and find Suzan´.
Daughter, let me see no more of this childishness.
Such rebellion is unworthy of you and most distressing
to me. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Poor Steenie! her tears ceased instantly, and
her grief turned to anger. At that moment she
felt that she had not a friend in the world, and
her proud little heart resented the apparent want
of sympathy she met with everywhere. With a
very decided stamp of her little boot-heels, she
marched out of the room,&mdash;“eyes front, right
face,” as Bob would have commanded, though
not in a spirit to be commended.</p>

<p>“<i>Lastima es</i> [it is a pity], my Little Un!”
cried old Sutro, hurrying after his darling, only
to have her turn fiercely upon him, and order
him to “keep his pity to himself. And I want
no Suzan´! I want nobody,&mdash;nobody at all!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a very wet and heated little
face was buried in the white pillows, and Steenie
Calthorp had settled herself in bed, convinced
that she was the most ill-treated child in the
world, and resolved to enjoy her misery to the
utmost. Only unfortunately for her doleful
plans, she was by nature very sunny and hopeful,
and she was also perfectly healthy. In about
two winks she happened to think of the next
day’s “circus,” and before she knew it she was
asleep, with a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>Suzan´ entered softly and stood by the bed for
a moment, shading her lamp with her hand and
lovingly regarding the little maid. “Bless her
dear heart! she’s shed more tears this day than
in all her little life before. But she’s happy
now,&mdash;happier ’n anybody else at San’ Felisa.
My, my! what’ll ever we do without the Little
Un? But master, he’s worried about her crying;
though, sure, if he’d bothered less about books
and business, and more about his own pretty flesh
and blood, maybe his eyes’d a been better the
now, poor man!”</p>

<p>Then she went away as gently as she had
come; and when next Steenie awoke, the brilliant
California sunshine streaming in at her
window was not brighter than that within her
own heart.</p>

<p>“Such a day, such a day! Will it ever come
noon!”</p>

<p>“True. And all too soon, Miss Steenie, for that
I’ve to do. Because, what has his lordship done
but give orders for a big feed for all the people
who are coming to see you show off?”</p>

<p>“To see&mdash;me, Suzan´? Why, not me, but
all the boys. I’m not to do a thing till the very
last, Bob says; and then only just ride and drive
a little. Maybe they will get tired, and won’t stay
till the end, so I won’t get a chance to do anything;
’cause Bob says he’s ’ranged a dreadful
long program. I think that’s what he called it.”</p>

<p>“In verity, <i>querida</i> [my darling]! I believe
you are the only one worth seeing, Lord Plunkett
says. I heard one of the fellows giving him some
talk about you, and he kept rubbing his fat little
hands, and saying things so odd. Sounds like
water coming out of a bottle. ‘Wonderful!’
‘Strange!’ ‘Hm-m!’ ‘What?’ till I had to
laugh. Think of&mdash;him&mdash;for a lord! Much I
care to read stories about ’ristocratics any more!
He hasn’t any ‘raving locks,’ nor ‘coal black
eyes,’ nor nothing. Isn’t half as handsome as
a’most any of the boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! Never mind him! Hurry up
with my hair, won’t you, please? My! how you
do pull! I wish my father’d let me wear it short,
like his; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> No. Your hair is the prettiest
thing about you, except your eyes, and maybe&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stuff! who cares for pretty? If I had to
twist my hair up in rags every night, like you do,
dear Suzan´, I’d be mis’able. But I s’pose you
can’t help it. You’re grown up. It must be
dreadful to get grown up, and as old as you are,
poor, nice Suzan´!”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> Humph! And me only twenty-five my
last birthday. If it was Ellen, now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind Ellen. And I love you, dear
Suzan´, if you are old; and I’m sorry ever’ time
I’m fidgety ’bout my hair. You won’t ’member
it against me, will you, after I’m gone? ’Cause
I don’t mean any badness; it’s only this quick
temper and can’t-keep-stillness of mine. I just
want to run, run, or something, all the time.
And keeping tidy, like my father says, is a bother.
There! you’ve done, haven’t you? Can I go?
Kiss me, Suzan´!”</p>

<p>Away danced Steenie, leaving her kind attendant
feeling already heavy-hearted in anticipation
of the time when there would be no restless little
creature for her fond fingers to attire, and no little
outbursts of impatience to correct.</p>

<p>But presently, all other thoughts save those
connected with the immediate affairs of the day
were banished by the tasks which Suzan´ found
to do. There were chickens to roast, cakes to
bake, biscuits by the hundred to be made, and
pies&mdash;such rows of pies! that the arms of cook
Ellen and her assistants, Win Sing and Lun Hoy,
ached with the rolling of pastry.</p>

<p>But they were not dismayed. Not they!
Didn’t they always cook just as much when the
sheep were sheared, or the feast after the “roundup”
was held? A pity if Santa Felisa couldn’t
respond to any demand made upon her larder,&mdash;especially
by order of her owner, a real live
British lord!</p>

<p>So the great ovens were fired, both in the
house-kitchen and in the old adobe cooking-sheds
outside; and a corps of white-aproned helpers
attended the roasting and stewing and baking of
all the good things which Mistress Ellen and her
aids prepared. While under the eucalyptus-trees
bordering the arroyo, Suzan´ gayly directed the
spreading of the long tables that would seat, if
need be, full two hundred guests.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it fun!” cried Steenie, darting about
from one point to another of the gay and busy
scene; and always having in tow the perspiring
Lord Plunkett, who found no breath left for even
his short sentences, but contented himself by
beaming graciously upon each and every one he
met.</p>

<p>“Tug an’ a canawl-boat!” said Bob, regarding
the pair somewhat jealously. “Don’t see why
the Little Un need stick to him so closet, even
if he is a bloated lord!”</p>

<p>“Never you mind, Bob! Let the Little Un
alone. Ain’t she happy? Ain’t she a purty sight?
Brim full o’ smiles an’ chipper as a wren? What
more do ye want?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’. But ’pears ter me she needn’t be so
powerful glad ’bout leavin’ us. I&mdash;don’t feel much
like laughin’. And she’d oughter be practisin’.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worrit. It’ll be all right. Little Un’s
square. She won’t ferget us, you bet! An’ she’ll
do the ‘great act’ all the better fer bein’ light-hearted.
Land! I only hope them cold-blooded
Easterners’ll make her half as glad as she’s always
be’n at San’ Felis’! But&mdash;ain’t it gittin’
nigh dinner-time? Folks air beginnin’ ter come
a’ready. Understan’ the spread, general, ain’t
ter be till afterwards?”</p>

<p>“No. An’ the one ’t carries off first prize is ter
perside. Well. I hope it’ll be our ‘Mascot.’ Do
me prouder ’n if it was myself.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” echoed his comrade, and departed
to snatch a hasty luncheon.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Lord Plunkett announced,
breathlessly: “I&mdash;I can’t. Stop. Wait. Hungry.
As&mdash;a&mdash;grizzly. Ever since&mdash;I came. Beats
everything. Appetite. Come. Eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, funny man! However can
you think about eating&mdash;now? Why, I just
want one o’clock to come so much I can’t wait!”</p>

<p>“Eh? What? Not afraid? Ride&mdash;same’s
nobody here?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;yes,” answered Steenie, slowly, as this
new idea presented itself. “Why shouldn’t I?
Indeed, I ought to do a great, great deal better;
’cause I wouldn’t like to dis’point dear old Bob.
Nor you,” she added politely.</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Bob first. Then&mdash;me. Hm-m.
You’re no&mdash;Anglomaniac. See that. Plain.”</p>

<p>“Wh-a-t, sir?” asked the little girl, astonished
by the long, strange word he had used.</p>

<p>“No matter. Nice child. Spunky&mdash;but good.
The way I like them. See here?” He held
up a small purse in which were displayed six
glittering double eagles. “Prizes. Eh? Win
’em? Highest&mdash;three; next&mdash;two; last&mdash;one.”</p>

<p>But Steenie was a little California girl, and
her eyes were not dazzled by the sight of gold.
Of its intrinsic value she had no idea; for in the
course of her short life she had had no occasion to
use any money. The prizes, therefore, represented
nothing to her beyond themselves; and
as playthings she did not care for them.</p>

<p>“Are they? Then I hope the boys will get
them all. ’Specially Jim. He’s got a mother,
an’ she’s got a consumption, or something. And
he’s going to bring her out to live in California,
sometime. It’s ter’ble cold where she stays now,
my father says; and he ’vises Jim to fetch her.
They’re money; and they would help, wouldn’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Yes. And you&mdash;don’t want them?”</p>

<p>“If he can’t win them I do. I’d rather he’d
get them himself, ’cause he’s so pleased when he
beats anybody; but if he can’t&mdash;why, I will&mdash;I
hope. Now I know ’bout them, he must have
them.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m,” said Lord Plunkett again, grimly.
“Oddest child. Like her. Immensely.”</p>

<p>“Steenie!” called Mr. Calthorp; and she darted
toward him. “Are you sure that you wish to
ride in this exhibition, darling? Are you timid?
Because there are a great many here, it seems;
and you need not if you do not like. It will be
different from an ordinary occasion.”</p>

<p>“But I do wish, Papa dear, if you don’t mind;
because Bob would break his heart if I didn’t.
He told me so. And I’m going to win, too.
Then I’ll get a lot of money to give poor old Jim,
for his mother. Yes, yes! I want to ride! And
I will&mdash;win!”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>SUTRO’S EXHIBITION.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Before the entertainment
really began,
Sutro Vives
gave a little private
exhibition
on his own account;
and his
dashings to and
fro across the
arena, directly
in Lord Plunkett’s
point of
view, were intended to excite that gentleman’s
curiosity and admiration,&mdash;which object was
accomplished.</p>

<p>“Gorgeous. Old Spaniard. Silver. Robbed
a mine.”</p>

<p>Steenie, mounted on her piebald Tito, was
standing close to the seat erected for the proprietor,
and explained for his benefit: “Oh,
Sutro has had all those things for ever so long;
since he was a young man, I b’lieve. He said
he would show you what an ‘old Ca’fornian
caballero was like!’ See! He’s all red and yellow
and white. Listen to the tinkle of the silver
chains among his trappings! Isn’t he proud as
proud&mdash;my Sutro? My father says his vanity
would be ’musing if it weren’t so ’thetic.”</p>

<p>“Pathetic, dear;” corrected Mr. Calthorp,
guided by her voice to her side.</p>

<p>“Pathetic? Why?” demanded Lord Plunkett.</p>

<p>“Because although his family was once wealthy,
almost beyond compute, this poor old fellow is
reduced to live a dependent on the lands that
were his fathers’, now a stranger’s. His shrivelled
body in that gay attire is but a fitting type of
his changed fortunes.”</p>

<p>“Why! Pshaw! Hm-m,” commented his
lordship, uneasily, distressed, as he ever was, by
thought of any other’s unhappiness.</p>

<p>“But, Papa dear, isn’t he always talking
about his ‘estate’? He says that he is richer
still than anybody hereabout; and that if he
wants money all he has to do is&mdash;something or
other!”</p>

<p>“The case with most of us,” laughed Mr.
Calthorp. “But Sutro does still retain a small
piece of property,&mdash;small as compared with his
former possessions, apparently as worthless as
the Mojave. It is the last spur of the mountain
range on the east, there; and, from its peculiar
summit&mdash;a gigantic rock cleft into three peaks&mdash;called
Santa Trinidad. Can you see? Point
it out, Steenie, please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. See. Barren. Worth nothing?”</p>

<p>“So I think. So others have thought; or
worth so little that in any transfer of this <i>hacienda</i>
[estate] no purchaser has been anxious to possess
La Trinidad, even if it had been for sale.
There are many ugly traditions concerning it;
but the plain and existing fact is quite ugly
enough for me. It is infested with rattlesnakes,
its cloven crest being their especial
home.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Crime. Exterminate. Should be.”</p>

<p>“They do not wander far afield; but, should
they become troublesome they would, doubtless,
be exterminated. The Indians are their natural
enemies&mdash;or friends; seeming to have no fear
of them, yet killing them off in great numbers
for the sake of their oil, which is sold at high
prices.”</p>

<p>“Try to buy it. Trinidad. Hm-m. How
much to offer?”</p>

<p>“I cannot advise you; for Sutro would fix its
value at an absurdly enormous figure. Besides,
there is no hope of his selling. Hark! Isn’t
that the signal for the ‘Grand Entree’?”</p>

<p>The notes of a fifer, playing merrily, floated
across the arena. It was the signal agreed upon,
and the thirty-odd horsemen who were to participate
in the tournament gathered hastily behind
the canvas screen on the opposite side of the
campus.</p>

<p>Now, as has been said, Steenie was not expected
to ride until the closing part of the entertainment;
and she might have remained by her
father’s side, a mere spectator of all the rest, had
she so desired; but when, at the first notes of
the musician’s call, old Sutro plunged spur into
Mazan´’s flank and dashed forward to the meet,
her excitement rose to the highest. She sit still
and watch!&mdash;while Tito’s dainty hoofs were
dancing up and down, like feminine feet eager
for the waltz! No, no! Not so, indeed! Away
she flew, and the piebald horse followed the
brown mare behind the canvas wall.</p>

<p>“Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! Toot-a-toot!” Emerged
the young Mexican fifer on his sturdy broncho;
and though he was proud indeed of his position
that day, he was but the preface to the story,&mdash;unnoticed
and of small account.</p>

<p>Sutro Vives really led the cavalcade, having
been appointed to this honor because of his age,
and perhaps of his assumption,&mdash;for he was not
the one to lose the prestige a little swagger gives
to a weak argument; and, although he was a fine
rider, there were many others finer, and Kentucky
Bob’s great gray horse was far ahead
of pretty Mazan´ for symmetry and graceful
strength.</p>

<p>However, the latter person was quite willing
to “play second fiddle so long’s the Little Un’s
with me,” and she had naturally guided Tito to
the gray’s side.</p>

<p>The other actors in the entertainment followed
in single file, and even a captious critic would
have been forced to admit that they made a
magnificent appearance. The glossy sides, the
waving manes and tails, the gay caparisons and
the regular hoof-beats of the beautiful animals fitly
accorded with that free bearing of the stalwart
riders, which is native to those who dwell in wide
spaces and under no roof but the sky.</p>

<p>Upon Lord Plunkett, to whom all this was new,
the impression made by that scene was profound.
It exceeded his highest expectations, and they
had been great. It made him feel himself a
bigger man&mdash;physically and mentally&mdash;to be
served by such men as these, and his kindly
heart warmed to the “Americans” then and
there with a degree of respect and cordiality he
had never before accorded them.</p>

<p>Then the marchings and countermarchings
began, and Steenie with a childish caprice darted
out of the ranks again and back to her father’s
side, to whom she eagerly described all that was
going forward; already learning with the intuition
of her tender heart to become “sight to the
blind,” and assuming toward him a motherly air
which sat quaintly enough upon her merry face.</p>

<p>“Eh? What? Hm-m. Why?” queried the
guest of honor, as, some time later, a prolonged
shout rent the air; for he could see nothing
especially fine about the half-dozen lads who now
rode into the arena upon the backs of their rough-coated
bronchos.</p>

<p>“The programme!” cried Steenie, determined
that a paper prepared with such labor by one of
her “boys” should be duly appreciated.</p>

<p>“Hm-m! ‘Number Seven. Knife Act!’ Well?
What?”</p>

<p>“Watch and see, dear Mr. Plunkett! Look&mdash;look!
It’s better than telling.”</p>

<p>“And something as difficult as rare,” added
Mr. Calthorp.</p>

<p>The performers of “Number Seven” rode
quietly to the centre of the field, where one
stooped to plunge into the soft earth a large
knife, burying the blade to the hilt. Then the
six horsemen wheeled and rode slowly back to
the starting-point, whence, at the fifer’s signal,
they began a wild and wide circuit of the “ring,”
repeating this several times. Each repetition
brought them nearer to the centre; and at last,
when they had attained their maddest, fleetest
pace, the contestants uttered a shout, and bore
down upon the projecting knife-handle. Each
rider leaned far out of his saddle, his brow almost
sweeping the ground, his eyes fixed upon one
object, and his jaws set firmly for their task.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;don’t understand. Eh?”</p>

<p>“The knife! the knife! See! Each has one
trial; each seeks to be first. See how they
crowd! To pull it out with his teeth&mdash;See!
See! Ah! Natan´! Na-tan´!” The child’s
voice rose to a shrill cheer, which was caught
up and echoed again and again.</p>

<p>Natan´, indeed, who with the knife-hilt still in
his teeth and the fierce-looking blade presented
to the view of the spectators, lifted his hat in
acknowledgment of the plaudits, and rode straight
toward his beloved “Mascot.” Then he accomplished
a second feat, scarcely less difficult than
the first; for still at break-neck speed he reached
Steenie’s side, and, without touching the knife
with his hands, thrust it deftly through a gay
little cockade fixed to Tito’s head-stall. Then
he rode off again at the same unbroken pace, and
the “Seventh Number” of the programme was
ended.</p>

<p>“Hark! the fifer again! That is my signal!”
exclaimed Steenie, and waving her hand, galloped
away to join the “boys.”</p>

<p>“Number Eight” was a trial of skill almost
as difficult as the “knife race” had been, and
consisted in lifting from the ground, while riding
at full speed, a handkerchief which had been
thrown there. Now, Steenie’s childish arms
could not compete with those of grown men,
and to supplement their shortness she was to hold
the knife which Natan´ had won, and catch up
the handkerchief on its point,&mdash;if she could!</p>

<p>“Of course, it is a foregone conclusion that she
will win,” remarked some person near Mr. Calthorp.
“Those fellows idolize that child, and
they won’t half try to beat her.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, but it will be a ‘fair, square’
trial,” corrected the manager, turning toward the
speaker. “Steenie would not ride if they had
not promised her that. She is determined to
win, and I think she will, but she will do so
honestly. She is quicker of motion than the
others, and has a judgment about distances which
seems like instinct. Besides, she and Tito have
grown up together, and he understands her like
a second self.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Not afraid? Danger? Thrown?”</p>

<p>“No, my lord, I am not afraid. She never
was thrown, and she began her riding in the first
year of her life.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What? Amazing! ‘California story’?”</p>

<p>The proud father laughed. “A ‘California
story,’ certainly, but a true one. Those fellows
adopted her from the outset. They fixed up a
sort of box-saddle, cushioned and perfectly safe,
and strapped it on Tito’s back. He was but a
colt then, and I would not have allowed it perhaps;
but they persuaded Suzan´ in my absence,
and when I saw how it worked I did not object.
That is how it began. To-day&mdash;it ends.”</p>

<p>A sudden wave of regret swept over poor Mr.
Calthorp’s heart, and turning away from a spectacle
his affliction prevented his witnessing, he
sought the retirement of his own apartments.
“My dear little girl! How changed her life
will be! From this freedom, this queenship, into
the restriction of a country town and the submission
of a schoolroom. Best for her, doubtless,
but&mdash;poor little Steenie!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Steenie neither pitied nor even
thought of herself. Side by side with four other
competitors, the piebald Tito kept his own place,
and tossed his head in equine enjoyment of the
excitement, while his young mistress applauded
him softly, with that praise which was incitement
as well.</p>

<p>Round and round the course, till the child’s
eyes glittered and her cheeks glowed at the shouts
of encouragement which reached her from every
point. “Go it, Little Un!” “Hurrah for the
‘Mascot’!” “The Little Un’ll win, you bet!”</p>

<p>Such admiration is not the best mental diet for
a young human being, perhaps, but it had not as
yet hurt Steenie; and this was probably the last
time that it would be hers. With a loyal recognition
of the good-will expressed, she waved her
hand and laughed and nodded, and “rode her
level best.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye let nobody better ye, Little Un, else
you’ll break Bob’s old heart!” warned that
worthy, himself urging the gray horse to its
utmost.</p>

<p>“Not I!” returned his pupil, and dashed ahead.</p>

<p>Evidently the contest was between these two,
who had outstripped the rest, and now crowded
each other for the shortest line toward the fluttering
bit of cambric on the path before them.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah! Tito, my Tito! Now, now!
<i>Vamos!</i> Quick&mdash;a spurt! Win&mdash;you must!”</p>

<p>Under the very nose of the gray, the little piebald
darted, with his rider half-hanging from the
saddle and the knife ready for action. Even
Bob’s well-trained animal swerved a little,&mdash;a
trifle merely, but it cost his master the prize.</p>

<p>No perceptible halt, but a dip, a rise, and Tito
was already half-way across the course again, his
mistress rising in her saddle, and waving triumphantly
above her head the shining knife with
the handkerchief it had pierced clinging about
the hilt.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Waving triumphantly above her head the shining knife with the

</div>

<p>If they had cheered before, the crowd went
fairly wild at that. Old Sutro and Connecticut
Jim, sworn enemies that they were, turned in
their saddles and hugged each other. Lord
Plunkett shouted and waved till he looked apoplectic;
and the reiterated cheers, “Another for
the Little Un!” “Another!” brought Mr. Calthorp
from his darkened office once more, this
time with a smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>But the hour grew late, and the assemblage
hungry. There was, accordingly, no delay in
giving the last exhibition, which was Steenie’s
alone.</p>

<p>“The child&mdash;prodigy&mdash;must not leave. Like
her; like her!” said Lord Plunkett again, as the
manager approached.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are pleased; but I think
that you will enjoy this driving scene even more.
There is no racing, no danger. If the horses are
not out of training, their action is wonderfully
fine and graceful. Does that shout mean her
entrance?”</p>

<p>“No. Horsemen. Single. Taking stations&mdash;regular
intervals&mdash;around the track.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I understand. They do that to watch
the horses, for the child’s sake. At the least
intimation of any animal being fractious or out
of accord with the rest, the nearest caballero
rides up and sets the matter right. Usually a
word of command will answer, but sometimes an
outrider accompanies her for the whole distance,&mdash;an
extra one, I mean, besides Bob, who always
follows close behind Steenie; generally in silence,
but ready with advice if it is needed. That second
signal&mdash;is it she?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Pretty! pretty!”</p>

<p>In her little wagon, to which was attached a
wide, curious whiffle-tree, Steenie emerged from
the canvas gateway, driving a pair of matched
bays. The fifer had stationed himself in the
centre of the plain, with a drummer beside him;
and if the music they there discoursed was not
sweet, at least it was inspiriting, and rendered in
good time. Best of all, it was the same that had
been used in training the horses, and they recognized
it at once, falling into step immediately and
almost perfectly.</p>

<p>The tune of “Yankee Doodle” fits perfectly
the stepping of a horse; besides which, it is
patriotic, and Kentucky Bob was nothing if not
American. To the tune of “Yankee Doodle,”
then, this “act” was given; and though Mr.
Calthorp smilingly apologized that they had not
chosen “God Save the Queen,” the delighted
Englishman “didn’t mind in the least.”</p>

<p>“What, what! another pair, eh? Hey?”</p>

<p>“Has she made the circuit once?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Four; drives four!”</p>

<p>Around the course again danced the horses, four
abreast, and not a break in their paces from start
to finish.</p>

<p>“You darlings! you have never done so well!
Do you know that I am to drive you no more?
And are you being just perfect and splendid for
that?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s ’cause they’re afeard of the
Britisher!” said a vaquero, teasingly.</p>

<p>“No, no! it’s because they love me. Now,
you others, remember&mdash;not one blunder!”
This to the third pair which was being attached
to the cart, these last in advance of the other
four.</p>

<p>It really was wonderful,&mdash;so wonderful that
not a sound was heard save the strains of the
music and the unbroken “pat-pat” of those
rhythmic hoof-beats. But when the fourth circuit
was completed, and waving the soft reins
which her childish hands seemed too small to
hold, Steenie stood up in her wagon behind the
eight now motionless horses, a cheer went forth
that dwarfed all which had gone before, and that
caused actual tears to dim the vision of happy
Kentucky Bob.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! my Little Un! you done me proud!
I can gin up livin’ now! There’ll never be
nothin’ better ’n that sight fer these blamed
watery eyes! Not a fail, not a break-step, not
a nothin’, but jest cl’ar bewitchments!”</p>

<p>“There you spoke. Nothing but a witch-bairn,
yet the bonniest this earth ever saw!” chimed
in the Scotch gardener.</p>

<p>“Are you glad, dear Bob?”</p>

<p>“Glad? I’m heart-broke! I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, my
Little Un! you wouldn’t go fer to leave San’
Felisy after this, would you?”</p>

<p>“Hark! the prizes! That queer little Englishman
’ll bust his b’iler soon if somebody don’t
pay heed to him! He’s a dancin’ a reg’lar jig
over there to catch our ’tention. I ’low you’ll
have to be took to him, Miss Steenie!” cried
Tony Miller.</p>

<p>“An’ I’m the man ’at’ll do it!” responded
her proud instructor, as, swinging his small pupil
to her accustomed place on his broad shoulder, he
strode away toward Lord Plunkett’s bench.</p>

<p>“Hm-m! Gives pleasure! Clever&mdash;wonderful!
Prize&mdash;won it! Eh? What? Everybody?”</p>

<p>“Huckleberries! Won it&mdash;of&mdash;course! Knew
she would!”</p>

<p>Stooping low, Steenie extended her hand eagerly
for the purse outstretched toward her, and
for a moment a revulsion of feeling swept over
the donor’s heart. For the sake of the reward,
then? So mercenary, was she?</p>

<p>But she had no sooner received it, and murmured
her hasty “Thank you,” than she demanded,
“Jim! Jim! I want Jim!”</p>

<p>Ah! my lord had forgotten “Jim,” and he
watched curiously as the shy fellow made his
way through the crowd to Bob’s side.</p>

<p>“Here, Jim! I’ve won it. It’s all for you.
For your consumption,&mdash;your mother’s, I mean.
That is, I’m going to give it to you if you’ll
promise me one thing. You will, won’t you,
dear Jim?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;Miss Steenie&mdash;I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be stupid, Jim! Think. Didn’t
you tell me ’bout the dear old mother an’ her consumption,
an’ how, if it wasn’t for your ‘habits,’
you’d bring her out to California to live in the
sunshine; but fast as you get your wages, away
they go on your ‘habits’? Didn’t you, Jim
Sutton?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“Well, you thought the Little Un didn’t know
what ‘habits’ were; but I asked my father, and
he says your ‘habits’ make you drink bad liquor
an’ stuff, an’ waste your earnings. You’re a good
man, my father says, an’ trustible, only for them.
So now, you see, we’ve got ahead of them for
once; and I want you to take this money and
send to that cold place and bring that good old
mother right away out here. Then you won’t be
lonesome when I’m gone, and she’ll keep you out
of ‘habits,’ like you said she could. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Will I, Little Un? You bet! An’&mdash;an’&mdash;I
can’t talk. Bob, you take it. You say sunthin’
fer me,&mdash;purty, like it orter be said. But&mdash;Lord!&mdash;I can’t&mdash;she ain’t&mdash;no
Little Un, no
‘Mascot,’ she ain’t; she’s a genooine-angel!”</p>

<p>And Steenie wondered why almost everybody
cried.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Some days later
a very weary
gentleman in
blue goggles
and a restless
little girl in queer attire,
occupying a section
of a railway
sleeper, heard the welcome
announcement of
the guard passing through the train: “Next
station will be Jersey City. Jer-sey-Ci-ty’s-the-next-sta-tion!”</p>

<p>Then followed the expressman with his insinuating
question of, “Baggage, sir? Delivered any
part of the city&mdash;baggage?” And the newsboy
with his patois of, “N’ Yo’k pape’s? Pos’-Sun-’Elegram-World!
Pape’s? N’ Yo’k pape’s?”</p>

<p>By that time all the passengers were in a bustle
of excitement,&mdash;women hunting and strapping
stray parcels; men standing up to stretch their
cramped limbs, while smiling congratulations to
one another that their three-thousand mile journey
was safely accomplished.</p>

<p>Cries of, “Porter, my coat!” “This way, Joe!
give me a brush next!” “Oh, we’re almost in!
See?” echoed here and there. Now, through rows
of houses, crowding faster and faster upon one
another; and then over a net-work of iron rails,
between numberless cars of every sort,&mdash;constantly
threatening a collision that was always
avoided,&mdash;pushed and panted the great “Overland,”
like an exhausted living creature longing
for rest.</p>

<p>All this was very familiar to Mr. Calthorp, but
quite new and formidable to his little daughter,
who nestled a bit closer to his side, and looked
about her with wide, observant eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you not glad, Steenie, my darling? A few
more trifling changes to make, another two hours
of railway journeying, and then we shall be at Old
Knollsboro, at Grandmother’s.”</p>

<p>“As glad as anything, Papa dear, only&mdash;”
She checked herself suddenly, remembering her
farewell promise to Kentucky Bob that she
would “keep a stiff upper lip, an’ not let the
‘Boss’ see her weaken, no matter if she did get
homesick!”</p>

<p>“Only what, dear?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don’t know. I feel so kind
of queer and sick-y inside of me. I’m not ill&mdash;like
eating too much candy; but&mdash;I don’t feel
very nice. I mean, it’s all right, dear Papa.
And I am really, truly glad. ’Cause then you’ll
get rested, won’t you? And you’ll go to the eye-man
and be fixed; and then&mdash;maybe&mdash;I s’pose
we’ll go home again.”</p>

<p>But already the train had stopped, and the
porter, who had neglected these two for more
importunate passengers, hurried up to give them
a farewell “brush” and to help them with their
parcels.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Mr. Calthorp required assistance
now as he had not done at familiar Santa Felisa.
The close confinement, the almost sleepless nights
of the long journey, and the growing anxiety, had
affected his dim vision most unfavorably; and
the constant attention of his little daughter was
necessary to him as he stepped from the car and
joined the throng of liberated passengers passing
forward into the station.</p>

<p>“Lead me into the ticket office. Can you make
it out? Ask any man in uniform.”</p>

<p>Steenie looked up startled. There was a sharp,
imperious note in her father’s voice which was
new to her, forced from him by the sudden conviction
that he was no longer losing his sight,
but that it was already lost, and that he had come
eastward&mdash;too late.</p>

<p>Obediently the little girl touched the arm of an
official, passing at that moment. “Please, sir,
will you tell us where to go? My father&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp took the explanation from her
lips, and the man in the blue uniform looked compassionately
upon these two who seemed so helpless,
and whose manner so plainly bore the stamp
of the far west, where threading narrow streets
and dodging crowds are not every-day events.</p>

<p>“Sorry, little one, but&mdash;I’m in a hurry. Call
somebody else;” and he turned away.</p>

<p>As he did so, he caught the quiver of a girlish,
travel-soiled lip, and a look of terror in a pair of
big blue eyes; and his feet refused to carry him
further from the spot.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Almost train-time&mdash;hm-m. All right,
Sissy. Here, this way, sir;” and slipping his
arm through Mr. Calthorp’s, the conductor of an
out-going “express” wheeled sharply about, and
guided his charges into a waiting-room, where he
consigned them to: “Here, you, twenty-seven!
Look out for these folks! There you are, little
one. This man will&mdash;” The rest was lost in the
distance as, with the skill of a veteran railroader,
the kind conductor boarded an already moving
car and disappeared.</p>

<p>A little act; but it cleared the mists from
Steenie’s eyes and the anxiety from her heart,
for already “Twenty-seven” was saying in tones
of cheery friendliness, “All right, little missy!
Whar yo’ an’ yo’ pa wanter go at?”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp’s explanations were repeated with
such clearness that, in another moment, a cab had
been summoned, the travellers assisted into it, and
the station-man dismissed, with a smile shining
on his black face and a new quarter in his palm.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit afraid now, Papa darling. I was
just at first, ’cause I didn’t understand the place.
But don’t you be worried now, we’re all right;
and won’t my grandmother be glad to see you!”</p>

<p>The returning invalid had his own opinion on
that matter; but he did not dampen Steenie’s
courage by expressing it.</p>

<p>She went on, heedless of his silence. “My!
what folks and folks! More than ever came to
our circus&mdash;even that last one! And what
makes ’em almost run? They ’bout hit each
other, don’t they? What big wagons! Oh, that’s
a pretty horse! What big ones at that wagon full
of ’normousest barrels! Why are they so many,
many folks, Papa dear? Ah, we’re stopping!”</p>

<p>More confusion&mdash;more changes; but always
somebody at hand to guide them, for Mr. Calthorp
had recovered his usual calm, alert manner,
and could direct, if he could not see his path.
A second brief railway trip, through which Steenie
slept comfortably against her father’s arm, and
then&mdash;they were standing before the great door
of a big white house, whence a brass lion’s-head
knocker grinned maliciously upon them. Though
unguided by his eyes, Mr. Calthorp’s hand rose
naturally till it seized a curious bar-like tongue
which hung from the beast’s mouth, and struck
it sharply against the polished plate.</p>

<p>“Whack! Rat-a-tat!”</p>

<p>Which brought the sound of approaching feet;
and the door opened noiselessly, to show within
the aperture a very stiff old man.</p>

<p>“Is Madam Calthorp at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But&mdash;my-soul-I-declare! Is it you,
Mr. Daniel?”</p>

<p>“And you, Resolved Tubbs? I know your
voice!” The visitor’s hand was extended and
clasped, though cautiously, by the trembling one
of the old servitor. “My eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see, I see, sir. This way&mdash;you know&mdash;Madam
is in the library. I don’t think she expected
you so soon.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. Though my secretary wrote.”</p>

<p>“This way, sir.” Mr. Tubbs had become himself
again: a wooden-visaged old man who liked
to express no opinion whatever, till it had been
formed for him by his mistress of many years.
He had not been able yet to judge whether that
mistress would rejoice at this home-coming of her
only son, or not; and he waited his cue before
knowing his own sentiments.</p>

<p>“Ah! if it is as it used to be, I can find my
own way, Resolved. The table by the wall&mdash;I
recall its red wool cover with the black stamp
exactly in the middle; the two oaken chairs
here; and here&mdash;the hat-rack! At home,
indeed! Even the very aroma of lavender and
southernwood from those upper chambers is
unchanged!”</p>

<p>Then the blue goggles could not hide the gladness
which leaped to the son’s face as he turned
the brass knob of the library door, and cried out,
“Mother! are you here?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s hesitation, which Daniel
Calthorp’s dim eyes could not see; then the rustle
of silken skirts, and the stately old lady of the
mansion had risen from her chair and crossed the
room, to take her boy’s hands in her own, and to
imprint upon his bearded cheek a kiss of greeting.
“So soon, Daniel? I had not looked for
you until next week.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I had a message sent. You see, I was
able to get through a bit earlier, and I could endure
no unnecessary delay. Here, darling, this
is Grandmother.”</p>

<p>In all her life Steenie had never looked upon
the face of any woman who bore a kinship to
herself, and the dreams of her romantic little
heart had clustered about this unknown relative
with an intensity such as only childhood knows.
So she scarcely waited to have her elders’ hands
unclasped before she sprang forward between her
father and his mother, and precipitated herself
upon that lady’s neck. “Oh, I thought you would
be pretty! but you’re prettier than anything I
ever saw!”</p>

<p>Madam Calthorp staggered a little,&mdash;perhaps
from the violence of this attack upon her person,
perhaps from surprise at the words; then she
quietly loosened the child’s clinging arms and
released herself. “You are an impulsive little
girl, Steenie! Let me see, how old are you?”</p>

<p>“Ten; going on ’leven.”</p>

<p>“Say ‘eleven.’ You are very large of your
age; I should think you might be older.”</p>

<p>Then there was an awkward silence, which the
son broke by groping across the room to a sofa
in the bay-window, where he sank down as if
exhausted. Steenie bounded to his side, flashing
a defiant glance at the tall old madam as she
passed. “What is it, my Papa? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“No, no; not at all! But we are both travel-soiled,
and unfit for your dainty rooms, Mother.
What quarters have you given us? We will go
and freshen up a bit.”</p>

<p>Old Tubbs, still waiting outside the door, listened
critically for his mistress’s reply. From it
he would form his own basis of action.</p>

<p>“I gave you the spare chamber, Daniel; your
daughter can take the little room next.” But
Madam’s voice, saying this, sounded as if she
were somewhat perplexed.</p>

<p>“Hm-m!” said Resolved to himself, “if she’d
answered up quick, ‘Your old room,’ I’d a knowed
she was glad, an’ meant things as they uset ter be.
But&mdash;‘spare room!’ that means he’s comp’ny.
She hain’t fergot how he went away, ner the
dozen years between. Well, my&mdash;soul&mdash;I&mdash;declare-I’m
sure I know which side my bread’s
buttered! An’ comp’ny it is!”</p>

<p>“Shall I carry yer bag, Mr. Daniel?” asked
this astute servant, as the travellers emerged
from the library.</p>

<p>“No! oh, no! thank you. I fancy I’m better
able than you, old fellow. Nothing wrong with
me but my eyes. This way, sweetheart.”</p>

<p>Whatever the feeling of disappointment in
Daniel Calthorp’s heart, there was nothing but
gayety in Steenie’s, as she tripped merrily up the
broad stairs behind him,&mdash;stopping now to examine
the slender polished rods which held the
carpet in place, and now to gaze through the window
on the landing at the old-fashioned garden,
where the late April snows still lingered in the
clefts of the lilac branches and made a white
border for the rows of box.</p>

<p>“Oh! isn’t it just like a storybook? And
my grandmother looks like pictures of queens.
She makes me think of the cleanest things I ever
saw. Did you notice?”</p>

<p>“Be eyes for me, little one, and tell me just
what you saw. Her face, is it wrinkled? Is her
hair gray? Did she wear glasses?”</p>

<p>“Her face is white,&mdash;whiter than anybody’s
I ever saw, ’cept Irish Kate’s little baby’s. And
her hair is like that pretty snow out there, all
round little rolls each side her eyes; and she
has some soft white stuff on her head, and more
around her neck and her wrists. Her dress is
black silk, and&mdash;I love her!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad&mdash;very glad of that!” exclaimed
Mr. Calthorp, earnestly. The power of Steenie’s
love he believed to be irresistible.</p>

<p>“But isn’t Mr. Tubbs funny? He makes me
think of raisin grapes that haven’t dried right.
And he wears his spectacles up on the bald part
of his head; and he looks lots older ’n Sutro.
How old is he, Papa?”</p>

<p>“Maybe seventy; I don’t know exactly. Now,
can you make yourself tidy alone? There are no
young women servants in this old house, and you
must do everything you can for yourself. But I
will help you with your hair if it bothers you, as
I did, or tried to do, on the train.”</p>

<p>However, he was saved this trouble; for at
that moment came a knock upon the door of the
little room assigned to Steenie, and, at her swift
opening of it, an old lady entered.</p>

<p>At least Steenie called her “lady,” and was
amazed when this prim person, in the black
alpaca gown and wearing spectacles, remarked:
“Madam sent me to wash and dress you. Come
here!”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I&mdash;I can do it for myself. I’d rather.
I’m very soiled; the car was so dusty And you
look so clean! Everybody is so ter’ble clean
here!”</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity! Come. I’ve no time ter waste.”</p>

<p>Steenie moved forward, slowly, and greatly
wondering. It had seemed all right to have gay
young Suzan´ preside at her toilet, but a severe-looking
and venerable creature like this was
quite a different matter.</p>

<p>“Where is the bath-room, please?”</p>

<p>“The bath-room! There ain’t none. Hm-m.
Did ye expect a palace?”</p>

<p>“A palace! I was talking ’bout water. What’ll
I do then? I’ve been a’most a week in that
dirty car&mdash;and I&mdash;Maybe Papa knows.” She
applied at her father’s key-hole for advice, and
he took the direction of affairs into his own
hands.</p>

<p>“Just fix up a tub in your old wash-room,
won’t you, Mary Jane? And let Steenie have
her splash there. It will save messing your
clean room, and I will explain to my mother.”</p>

<p>Mary Jane went away with a sniff, and her
nose in the air; sternly muttering about “folks
turning the house topsy-turvy, an’ thinkin’ the
hull world b’longed to ’em;” and Steenie followed,
meekly. She was very much in terror of
the sharp-visaged old spinster, whose favor she
had, however, unwittingly won by her desire for
cleanliness; although Mary Jane was not the
woman to admit that at once. She was shown
into the bare-floored, and rather chilly wash-room,
where a round blue tub was deposited upon
the boards with a decided bang, and promptly
partially filled with several buckets full of cold
water from the “system” pump, after which
Mary Jane disappeared.</p>

<p>Then the new-comer forgot her fear in her
curiosity, and was busily poking about, inspecting
her surroundings, when her ancient attendant re-entered,
tossed another pail of boiling water into
the previous ones of cold, and again withdrew.</p>

<p>An hour later, Steenie, very fresh and dainty
in her white frock, and with her rebellious curls
brushed into a semblance of order by her father’s
untrained hand, bounded gayly through the long,
cold halls, and in at the library door, just in
time to overhear the old servant explaining to
Madam: “She’ll be a cruel lot o’ trouble, an’
mebbe the death on us with her noise; but&mdash;she’s
clean! Why, ma’am, she says she takes
a hull body-wash, ever’ day on her life, an’ sometimes
twicet! An’ if it’s the truth, she’s one
youngun out of a million! an’ the only one ’t I
ever see ’t liked water in her nateral state.
She’s a phenomely. But&mdash;my floor! When I
went in, half an hour arterwards, there she stood,
dancin’ a reg’lar jig, roun’ an’ roun’, an’ splashin’
the suds all over her an’ the boards, an’ ever’
conceivable thing! I scairt her out, lively; an’
all she could say fer herself was: ‘It seemed so
good an’ funny to use a roun’ tub, stidder a reg’lar
long one.’ She’d a splotched out the last
drop in another minute. She must a be’n brung
up a reg’lar heathen, an’ her Mr. Dan’l’s only!”</p>

<p>Steenie, poised on tip-toe, listened to the close
of the harangue; certain from the words that
Mary Jane was frightfully angry and from the
tone that she was rather pleased. But, at that
moment, Madam Calthorp perceived her, and motioned
silence to the speaker.</p>

<p>“But I’m not a heathen, Mary Jane! My
father says a heathen is one who worships idols,
an’ I wouldn’t be such a dunce as that. I’ve a
whole lot of Indian idols at San’ Felisa, an’
they’re as ugly as ugly. The silly things make
them out of the same clay they do their jars and
dishes, an’ the jars are far prettier. My father
says&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Steenie, why have you put on a white frock
on such a day as this?”</p>

<p>“Why?” repeated the puzzled visitor. “It’s
a clean one, only wrinkled in the packing.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;a white dress in April! It is wholly
out of place. You will get sick, and have to be
taken care of. Take it off at once.”</p>

<p>All the gayety died out of the child’s face, rosy
from recent scrubbings with soap and water, and
radiant with health, and a look of strange perplexity
succeeded. “I&mdash;I can’t, Grandmother.
I haven’t any other.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;other&mdash;frock!”</p>

<p>“Not that is clean. My car one is ter’ble
dirty an’ dusty. My father says it isn’t fit to
wear any more; and my horseback one isn’t
unpacked; an’ my rest are just like this. I’m
sorry if it isn’t right;” with a deprecatory little
gesture that appealed strangely to Madam Calthorp’s
cold heart.</p>

<p>“Well, well! Do you wear such clothes as
these all winter in California?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I do. My father says ’at white is the
only ’propriate color for a little girl.”</p>

<p>“White is not a color, Steenie. Learn to be
accurate. But&mdash;go and ask Mary Jane to give
you my gray cashmere shawl, then put it on
directly. If you have no suitable clothes, some
must be procured for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” answered Steenie, obediently, and
ran away,&mdash;to return presently, sheathed in a
great gray calyx, from which her flower-like face
peered mischievously out. Then her father’s
steps were heard descending the stairs, slowly,
and the child darted off, once more, to clasp
his arm with a vigor that denoted deep emotion.
“Oh, Papa, it was too bad we came! Do you
know she doesn’t want us? My pretty, very own
Grandmother! She doesn’t say so, but I know
it. She doesn’t!”</p>

<p>Daniel Calthorp drew his darling closer to his
side; and though he smiled brightly enough, his
own heart echoed the disappointed words. He
had known from the moment when his mother’s
voice had fallen on his now super-sensitive ear
that his coming had brought her no pleasure, and
that she had been too truthful to put into her
welcome a warmth which she did not feel.</p>

<p>“Then we must be so patient and kind to her,
sweetheart, that she can’t help being glad, after
awhile. I depend upon you, my Blue Eyes, to
work a miracle.”</p>

<p>So they entered the Madam’s presence once
more, and together; and though she saw something
pathetic in the grouping of that helpless
pair, the disturbance and annoyance which their
coming was to her calm, self-sufficient life far
outweighed her pity.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">My-soul-I-declare!
you
here? Don’t ye
know Madam
don’t ’low nobody to
tetch her books?”
almost shouted Resolved
Tubbs, entering
the library
on the morning
following “Mr.
Daniel’s” arrival,
and, early as the
hour was, finding
the place already occupied by Steenie. Sprawling
flat upon the hearth rug, and supporting herself
upon her elbows, she turned the leaves of a
richly illustrated folio, while piles of other volumes
were heaped about her, in careless disregard
of injured bindings. She did not heed,
because she did not hear, the reproof; for at
that moment her childish soul was deep in the
“Inferno,” following the poet’s dark imagings
by the aid of Doré’s darker pencillings. She
had had the handling of few books in her short
life, but she “took to them” as naturally as did
her stately grandmother, whose quiet existence
for many years had been among them almost
wholly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear, sissy? You mustn’t tetch
’em, I tell ye! Git up, quick! I&mdash;I dunno
what on airth she’d say if she was ter come
in this minute!”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” asked Steenie, absently, lifting
a face white with horror, “is it true?”</p>

<p>“True as the gospel; you’d better look out!”</p>

<p>“Is it near here,&mdash;near this very Old Knollsboro’
town?”</p>

<p>“Hm-m! I vum I never see nothin’ like ye!
I do b’lieve ye ain’t right bright!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” again demanded the child, oblivious
to any personal remarks.</p>

<p>“I dunno nothin’ ’bout printed trash, an’ you
hain’t no call to, nuther. But you’ll hear sunthin’
’at ’ll make yer ears buzz if you don’t put them
books right square back where ye got ’em! I
ain’t a goin’ ter wait on ye, like you ’pear ter be
uset ter havin’ folks do! I’ve got the fires ter
’tend, the chores ter do, an’ ten thousan’ more
pesky things, all this very mornin’, an’ my lumbago
achin’ me fit ter split.”</p>

<p>“What’s a lumbago?” asked Steenie, sitting
up cross-legged, and trying to hold the great book
on her small lap.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;Thunder an’ lightnin’! Ou&mdash;uch!”
With a groan that was almost a yell, Resolved
arose from the stooping posture which, in an
unwary moment, he had assumed before the grate
he was cleaning, and clapped his gnarled fingers
to “the small of his back.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Steenie likewise sprang up and
retreated to the further corner of the apartment,
leaving the volume <i>de luxe</i> to fall where
it happened. “What’s the matter?” she demanded,
from that safe distance, half-laughing,
half-crying, for her vivid imagination had been
overwrought by the lurid pictures she had been
studying, and Mr. Tubbs’s shriek seemed to presage
some of the intolerable torments which she
had seen depicted.</p>

<p>“The lumbago, I told ye! Blast a youngun,&mdash;etarnally
askin’ questions! Wait till ye git
ter be as old as I be, an’ you ’ll know, I guess!”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait!” responded Steenie, willingly, and
with no intentional disrespect.</p>

<p>“Ye will, will ye? you saas-box! Where ye
ever lived ter have no respect fer age?” And,
mindless of his affliction, the exasperated Mr.
Tubbs started in pursuit of the offender, to drive
her from his sight.</p>

<p>But she, mistaking his intention, and fancying
a terrible resemblance between his pain-contorted
face and the anguished ones of the “Inferno”
engravings, crouched back in her corner, and,
throwing her arms up rigidly above her head,
uttered shriek after shriek of terror. Beyond
her mild dread of “seeing folks angry,” it was
her first experience of fear, and it took absolute
possession of her mind.</p>

<p>“Shet up! shet up! My-soul-I-declare,
you’re the beatenest youngun I ever see! Why
on airth couldn’t ye stay back thar in Californy
stidder comin’ ter torment them ’at don’t
want ye?” But as, in his eagerness to quiet this
unprecedented disturbance of that orderly house,
the deluded servant continued to advance menacingly,
Steenie continued to scream; until, in
the midst of the uproar, a white-haired figure
appeared in the doorway, when she darted instantly
forward and buried her face in her grandmother’s
skirt.</p>

<p>As Resolved afterwards expressed it, he “was
struck dumberfoun’ an’ couldn’t say nothin’;”
and as Steenie was also speechless, the startled
mistress of the house was left to draw her own
conclusions from the scene.</p>

<p>“Steenie, look up!”</p>

<p>Steenie shivered and obeyed. “Is it true,
Grandmother? Does he really, truly know?”
Again that unwonted stirring in the hitherto
cold heart of the Madam moved her to ask
almost gently, “What true, child?”</p>

<p>“About men being twisted into trees&mdash;and
swimming in flames&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;awful everythings!
He says so.”</p>

<p>The lady’s eyes strayed more critically over
the apartment, and, if any of that perfectly
trained woman’s movements could ever be such,
the start she gave was violent. Steenie felt herself
pushed suddenly aside, and saw her grandmother
cross hastily to the ill-used Dante, which
she raised with a care far more loving than she
had yet bestowed upon the motherless child of
her blind, only son.</p>

<p>“Steenie! Steenie Calthorp! Listen to me.
Understand me&mdash;fully. I forbid you ever
touching a single volume in this room, in this
house, which I do not, personally, place in your
hands.”</p>

<p>The little girl was too surprised to speak.
When, at last, she found her voice, she asked,
innocently enough: “Aren’t they to read? The
books!”</p>

<p>“By those who comprehend their value. But
you are to obey me, implicitly. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. So my father said,” answered
Steenie, sweetly. “But, you see, I didn’t know
they weren’t to be looked at till Mr. Resolved
said so. We didn’t have any books at San’
Felisa, ’cept Papa’s figurey ones, and some ’at
didn’t have pictures. Only mine. The ‘boys’
used to bring me lovely books, ever’ time they
went to town. They was ‘Jack the Giant Killer,’
and the Andersen man’s, an’ a beau-u-tiful
‘Mother Goose’! Father Antonio sent me a
prayer-book; but it was all in Latin, and my
father says I must learn English first.” The
presence of her grandmother had reassured the
child against any danger from the lumbago-frenzied
Mr. Tubbs, and she now leaned contentedly
against the wall, coolly watching the disarranged
volumes being returned to their shelves, and
quite free from any anger against anybody. But
she could not forget what she had seen, and
when Madam Calthorp had finished her labor,
had closed and locked the glass doors of the old-fashioned
book-cases, and turned to leave the
room, she went forward and clasped the lady’s
hand. “Did you ever read that book, Grandmother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is it English?”</p>

<p>“No, Italian. Dante, who wrote it, was an
Italian poet.”</p>

<p>“Is it near here,&mdash;where those poor people are?”</p>

<p>“Steenie! Ah, how can I tell!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you? I thought you knew everything.
My father says you are the most intelligy
woman of his ’quaintance. He said he wished
I could be like you; but he didn’t think I could,
’cause something was the matter with my nature,
’at made it diff’rent.”</p>

<p>“Say ‘dif-fer-ent,’ Steenie. Speak all your
words distinctly.”</p>

<p>“Dif-fer-ent. It takes longer, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It commonly takes longer to do things well
than ill. It is the fault of the present generation
to slur everything, in its rush for ‘time.’”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” assented Steenie, politely, to whom
this was as Greek.</p>

<p>“Did you ever go to school, my dear?”</p>

<p>“No. But my father says I may while I’m
here. I don’t much care about it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’cause. One thing, it’s in a house, he
says, an’ I like out-doors. I never stay in the
house, ’cept nights. Here comes Papa! Is
breakfast ready? I’m awful hungry.”</p>

<p>Steenie’s manners and speech continually jarred
upon Madam Calthorp’s ideas of propriety; and
propriety was the rule of her solitary life. But,
although she had dreaded this invasion of her
quiet by a “noisy child,” and by the son whose
many years of absence had made him seem a
stranger to her, yet she was impartial enough to
acknowledge that there was something very winning
and lovable about the little girl.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, mother and son retired to the
library to “talk business,” and the other member
of the family party was left free to amuse herself
as she chose. “Only take care not to meddle,
nor get into mischief, darling,” added Mr. Calthorp
to his kiss of dismissal.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it, Papa dear, but ’most ever’thing
here seems to be ‘mischief.’ I think I’ll
go out-doors.”</p>

<p>Madam did not hear this decision, or she would
have forbidden it,&mdash;not from any desire to thwart
Steenie’s enjoyment, but because the child was
not fitly apparelled to appear on the streets of
respectable Old Knollsboro, where, though fashions
were not advanced, very rigid notions were
held of what should or should not be worn.</p>

<p>Bare-headed and in her white frock, still bundled
about with the gray cashmere shawl, the
little stranger wandered out into the garden, and
thence to the street.</p>

<p>April was half gone, and till then the weather
had been cold; but that morning came one of
those sudden changes which seem like summer
warmth gone astray. The snow-patches melted
swiftly, the frozen sidewalks thawed, and the
whole earth became a bed of softest mud, over
which Steenie pursued her sticky way, too intent
upon her other surroundings to notice what went
on beneath her feet.</p>

<p>“How the birds sing! There are more birds
here than at San’ Felisa, I do b’lieve. And the
sun shines a’most as bright. Dear me! I wish
I’d worn my hat&mdash;but never mind. This shawl’s
awful hot. I’ll take it off an’ lay it on the fence.
Hm-m. How funny! Everybody has a big white
house an’ a little white railing around it, an’ that’s
all. But it looks pleasant down that road. I wish
Tito was here. Dear, darling Tito! It seems&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whooa! Whooa! I say! Hold&mdash;on&mdash;don’t&mdash;whooa-a!”</p>

<p>Steenie turned swiftly round. Down the street
behind her galloped a wildly excited horse, with
a little girl on his back; while following fast
came a second beast, ridden by a terrified groom.
The small equestrian had lost her control of her animal,&mdash;if
control she had ever had,&mdash;and he had
taken fright or become suddenly vicious; keeping
just so far in advance of the pursuer as to avoid
capture, and dancing upon his hind legs between
whiles, in a manner inimical to any rider’s safety
and doubly dangerous to one so young as she who
still clung to her saddle, her fingers clasping the
pommel in the rigidity of fear.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s running away! The naughty
fellow!”</p>

<p>Thought and action came together; for the very
sound of a horse’s foot-fall had roused Steenie’s
spirit to its full activity, even before she had
turned to learn that the sound meant danger.</p>

<p>“<i>Hola! Hola!</i>” she cried softly, and bounded
into the road; skimming the muddy surface like
a swallow and racing as her old Indian friend,
Wanka, had taught her in the games at Santa
Felisa. She had thrown up her hand, warningly,
to the groom, who, aghast at seeing a second
child rush into peril, checked his own horse,
almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>“That’s the wisest thing he could do! Why
didn’t he stop before?” thought Steenie; “that
little girl’s horse knew he was being chased,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>The small hands on the pommel were slowly
slipping loose; but the fleet-footed westerner had
gained the gray beast’s side, had sprung upon it,
had thrown herself astride the quivering shoulders,
and caught up the dangling bridle.</p>

<p>“Hold on to me, girl! Tight&mdash;my waist&mdash;I’ll
take care&mdash;<i>Hola, hola</i>, my pretty one! <i>Ce,
ce, ce!</i> Wouldst thou? But, no!”</p>

<p>How was it done? That is Steenie’s secret,
learned from Kentucky Bob and loyally kept because
of her promise; but this is what happened:
she leaned her face far forward till her pretty
lips were close beside the frantic animal’s ear,
and there cooed to him in half-whispered sounds,
till he paused for one second to listen,&mdash;and in
that brief instant yielded his equine will to her
human one.</p>

<p>“Good boy! So, so, my hero! Softly now,&mdash;as
a well-bred horse should go! Don’t you be afraid,
little girl! He’s&mdash;what’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Ki-inks,” faltered a timid voice.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think so! He’s full of kinks;
but he’s a beauty! Aren’t you, dear?” which
flattery the mettlesome creature seemed to heed,
for he fell into a measured pace, and tossed his
mane proudly, as who should say: “Behold me!
A fine fellow am I!”</p>

<p>A few rods further of this movement, then
Steenie checked Kinks entirely; and though he
quivered and trembled, and looked nervously
around at the groom riding up and the crowds
who had collected on the sidewalk, he suffered
the restraint imposed upon him by the stroking
of her soft little hands and her caressing voice.
Then she asked: “Where do you live, girl? Do
you want to go home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! I live down there,” answered the
rescued child, loosing one arm from her preserver’s
waist sufficiently to point forwards down
the avenue.</p>

<p>“Shall I get off? Can you ride alone?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;no! Let me down! Please!”</p>

<p>“Wait. Let me tell you. Is he your horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you love him?”</p>

<p>“Not&mdash;now. I did&mdash;but now I hate him!
Let me down!”</p>

<p>The groom approached and dismounted to obey
this demand; but Steenie wheeled sidewise, so
that Kinks could look his stable-mate squarely in
the face.</p>

<p>“Not yet, little girl. He’s beautiful, and you
ought to want to ride him. Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be. Something made him angry;
then he ran away. He’s ashamed now.”</p>

<p>“Ashamed? Why, how do you know?”</p>

<p>“He says so, plain enough. See here, Kinksey,
hold up your head. Look at your little lady
an’ tell her you’re sorry.”</p>

<p>To the astonishment of every on-looker the little
bareheaded stranger coolly seized the gray’s forelock
and pulled his head backward, so that his
eyes could be seen; and laughing softly, but lovingly,
she maintained his position till his owner
leaned forward and satisfied her own curiosity.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;it is so! He does look as if he
wanted to hide!”</p>

<p>It was quite true. If ever an equine countenance
expressed shame and regret, that of the
now humbled Kinks did so at that moment.</p>

<p>Probably it was the first time in their lives
that the people in that wondering crowd had
ever thought whether a horse was capable of
facial expression; and it gave them food for reflection.
Either their own eyes deceived them,
or the stranger child was a “witch,” or&mdash;a
horse did have emotions,&mdash;and showed them.</p>

<p>“Now, you won’t be naughty and unkind to
him, will you,&mdash;just because he didn’t behave
p’lite for once?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m not naughty. He’s nothing but a
horse, and I’m folks. I know things.”</p>

<p>“So does he. He knows more’n you or I do;
an’ he didn’t have to go to school, neither.”</p>

<p>“You’re an awful funny girl.”</p>

<p>“So are you. Say, shall I get off? Will you
ride him alone?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! Stay on. If you will, I won’t
get off at all. I’ll ride all the way home. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“May I? ‘<i>Sta buen</i>’ [that is good]! But
move back. I’m sitting horrid.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I fall off?”</p>

<p>“Won’t you&mdash;pooh! Are all girls afraid in
Old Knollsboro?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t&mdash;know.”</p>

<p>“I hope not. I’ve had a great cur’osity to
see another girl besides myself, but I never did,&mdash;that
is, to talk to ’em. If they’re all so scarey
as you, I shall be awful dis’pointed.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nasty, mean, hateful thing! So
there!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what?” The face which Steenie
turned toward her companion showed not the
slightest resentment, but the sincerest astonishment.
“What did I do?”</p>

<p>“You said I was ‘scarey’&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;things!”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you? I thought so. May be I
was mistookened. But Kinks thinks it’s time
to go. Are you ready? What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Beatrice. Ye&mdash;es. I&mdash;guess&mdash;so. Won’t he&mdash;run
away&mdash;again?”</p>

<p>“He’ll run like a coyote! But he won’t
behave bad any more. Ready?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es.”</p>

<p>“Now, then! <i>Pronto</i> [get on]!” Away dashed
Kinks, bearing his double burden, as if determined
to make up lost time, or to show the racing
quality of his blood; but, swift as was his
pace, he was no longer wild, and seemed but another
young thing, such as those who rode him,
overflowing with spirit and vitality.</p>

<p>“Ah, how good it seems! A’most like Tito!”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es. I&mdash;I like it!” assented Beatrice,
so exhilarated by the rapid motion that she forgot
her fear.</p>

<p>“Which way now?”&mdash;as they came to the
turn of the road.</p>

<p>“Down there, through the iron gate.”</p>

<p>“Is it his home,&mdash;and yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll give him his head;” and dropping
the bridle-rein upon his shoulders, Steenie folded
her arms while Kinks trotted more and more
slowly over the gravel road, till he stopped, of
his own accord, before the block where he was
accustomed to be mounted.</p>

<p>Both children were speedily off upon the
ground, and Steenie, feeling more at home and
happier than at any time since she had parted
from her four-footed friends at Santa Felisa,
began examining the various straps and buckles
of the gray’s harness, with a professional air
which greatly impressed the watchful Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Who saddled this poor fellow?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know, then! See here!
There’s a thorn in this surcingle. That’s all
how it happened!”</p>

<p>“That&mdash;little thing? And that big horse?”</p>

<p>The groom has ridden up by this time, and
Steenie turned upon him swiftly. “See here,
man! I found this in the band!”</p>

<p>“Well. What of it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what made him act up.”</p>

<p>“That is too small to have been felt.”</p>

<p>“I think not. See?” The child struck the
brier sharply into the flesh of her own brown
little hand, and a red flush followed the wound.
“That has hurt him ever since he went out. Bob
says nothing’s so sensitive as a horse; and then
something frightened him; and then he&mdash;ran
away. So would I,&mdash;if anything kept doing
this all the time!” And again she attacked her
own skin,&mdash;now so energetically that the blood
oozed out; at which she turned and clasped the
soft nostrils of the thorough-bred before her with
a tender pitying touch, and laid her own bonny
face caressingly against the face of the beast,
who stood in motionless enjoyment of this new
sympathy.</p>

<p>Nobody knew that a fourth person had observed
this scene till a grave voice quietly asked:
“Little girl, who are you?”</p>

<p>Then the curly head was reluctantly lifted
from its resting-place, and a pair of radiant eyes
were raised toward the porch where the questioner
stood. “I’m only Steenie Calthorp.”</p>

<p>“Only&mdash;the most wonderful child I ever
saw! Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Santa Felisa, California.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Memory returned to her. What, indeed, was
she doing there, when she had been told by
her grandmother that she must be ready in
just half-an-hour to “go and buy some decent
clothes!”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> I forgot!” And away flashed
a white frock and a streaming mass of curly
hair, without so much as a good-by to any of
these new acquaintances.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>STEENIE AND HER GRANDMOTHER.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Steenie had little
difficulty in retracing
her way
along the avenue
as far as that old
street of the
town on which
her grandmother’s
house
stood; but she
stopped, confused.</p>

<p>“It was a
big white house
with a lion on
it.” Alas! they were all big white houses in that
locality, and more than one had a “lion on it.”</p>

<p>“There is a white fence before it, and green
blinds.”</p>

<p>So were there everywhere,&mdash;for this staid,
aristocratic, inland borough was nothing if not
correct. Years and years before, when it was
young, its then leader of society had builded him
a “mansion,” standing so many paces back
from the street, of such a width and stature.
He had placed about the yard a protecting paling,
white,&mdash;to match the house; with its green
blinds which did not match the grass, but stared
at it in a hardness of tone, so utterly green, that
it made nature’s color look yellow,&mdash;maybe from
envy.</p>

<p>The example set in that far-away time continued
still. To the one big square white house
succeeded other big, square, white houses, as like
to the pattern as rule and measure could make
them; to the ugly green blinds other rows of
ugly green blinds; while the original paling
stretched out far, far on either side.</p>

<p>Thus the great High Street of Old Knollsboro
began and grew; and now was far too loyal to
its past to alter its own cleanly and roomy
monotony for any modern freaks of architecture.</p>

<p>It was on this thoroughfare that a strange
little girl, who had never been lost on the wide
plains of Santa Felisa, now stood looking about
in awe-stricken perplexity. She began, also,
to feel physically very miserable. Clouds had
obscured the sun, and the wind had risen chilly,
blowing through her light attire with a piercing
breath new to her experience, and most unpleasant.
Her shoes were water-soaked, and her feet
stiff with the cold; and such a terrible forlornness
suddenly overcame her that she felt very much
like crying.</p>

<p>“But if I cry I can’t see anything, then!”
said this practical small creature, and forthwith
restrained her tears. “Well, it must be further ’n
this, anyhow; an’ if I go on, maybe I’ll see a
Maltese cat. Mary Jane says her cat is pure
Malty; and so&mdash;Ho! There she goes!”</p>

<p>Thinking wholly of the animal which was to
be her guide, Steenie pursued a fleeing object
that she believed to be Mary Jane’s possession;
but she was disappointed at the very gateway of
successful capture, beneath which the cat darted
and through which the child would have followed
but for the latch; about this her observant eye
detected a radical difference from that of Madam
Calthorp’s.</p>

<p>“Hm-m, Miss Cat! You’ve run away again,
I s’pose. Mary Jane says you are always running
away an’ ‘pestering the life out of her.’
An’, maybe, you’re like me,&mdash;don’t know where
you do b’long. Never mind. I guess you’ll
find your way home again; so I’ll go on.”</p>

<p>Steenie was so oddly and thinly clothed for
that season and climate that some curious eyes
looked after her sturdy little figure, as she passed
swiftly up the street, darting questioning glances
at every residence; but nobody thought of offering
guidance. For wasn’t Old Knollsboro in
morning attire? Besides, open curiosity concerning
one’s neighbors was a common thing, and
belonged to the vulgar crowd which did not
inhabit High Street. So she made the full length
of one side the roadway and had crossed to return
upon the other, when she spied in the distance
a bent, blue-coated old man, whom she
recognized at once.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Tubbs! It truly is! Hurrah!” she
cried, with a delight quite contrasting to the
terror this same person had caused her earlier in
the day. Then she sped forward till she had
overtaken and thrown herself upon her victim’s
shoulders, who rebounded from the shock of the
attack with a groan horrible to hear, but which
no longer daunted the glad child. “Oh, you
dear Mr. Resolved! Here you were, looking for
me, and all the time I was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t lookin’ fer ye ’t all! Oh, oh! Be
ye born ter murder me outright, er be ye not?
Um&mdash;m! That’s what I’d like ter know.”</p>

<p>“Murder you? Why, you must be funny!
How, why should a little girl murder anybody?”</p>

<p>“My-soul-I-declare! But you seem boun’ ter!
An’ in the name o’ common sense, what be ye doin’
out here with no clothes on ter speak of? Where’s
yer bunnit er yer shawl?”</p>

<p>Shawl! Steenie had never thought of it from
the moment when she took it off and laid it on
the fence. The fence! What fence? Where?
All up and down those two long rows of palings
which faded into an indistinct line and seemed to
melt together in the distance, the child’s eyes
searched critically. But there was nothing in
sight to suggest the shawl, which had been only
loaned by Madam Calthorp, and Steenie’s fear
took a new direction. What if it were lost?&mdash;as
she had been, and the Maltese cat.</p>

<p>She had been trained to a very nice observance
of “thine” and “mine;” and even at Santa Felisa,
where she was so universally loved and indulged,
she had never mislaid or used anything belonging
to another without permission. How dreadful to
begin now with something owned by that stern,
beautiful grandmother whom she already loved
so dearly, yet who seemed too “intelligy” to return
such a simple sentiment!</p>

<p>“Which is my grandmother’s house, Mr. Resolved?
Please, will you show me?&mdash;even if you
weren’t sent after me.”</p>

<p>“Sent arter ye! Humph! Psst-t’ I’d like
ter see myself bein’ sent arter younguns, at my
time o’ life!”</p>

<p>“Where, please? Quick!”</p>

<p>For answer the old man pushed his spectacles
into their legitimate place and looked at the questioner
searchingly. “Well, I hate ter own it, but
I s’pose I’ll have ter. I ’lowed ter Mary Jane
fust off, ’t ye didn’t seem like common younguns;
an’ then that fool kind o’ talk this mornin’; an’
now, a losin’ of yerself in a plain straight road
like this. It’s a pity,&mdash;it’s a terr’ble pity.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is. But don’t you see? I did it
just because it <i>is</i> so plain. I was never outside
my grandmother’s house before, only when we
came. And I was so tired I didn’t notice; an’
these rows and rows look just like a flock of
sheep, each more the same than the other; and
if you won’t tell me”&mdash;A fit of shivering cut
short her remarks.</p>

<p>“Gracious! You ain’t a ketchin’ cold, be ye?
A’ready? This way, then, suddent! Er there
ye’ll be ter be nussed.” With which humble
imitation of his mistress’ sentiments, Mr. Tubbs
faced about, and seizing Steenie’s cold little hand,
hurried back to their own domicile as fast as age
and lumbago would permit.</p>

<p>“Now, look a here. Take a notice. Ye mayn’t
be bright, but ye can l’arn sunthin’, an’ I’m boun’
ter teach ye. That gate-latch has a round quirl
on the top. See? an’ there hain’t another gate-latch
has a nothin’ but a square quirl the hull
endurin’ length o’ High Street. Do ye understan’
what I’m a sayin’?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, certainly. Why shouldn’t I?”
laughed Steenie, forgetting her fear of her guide
in gratitude for his “kindness” in returning her
to her friends, and wondering why he thought
her so slow of comprehension. But no sooner
was the “round quirled” latch lifted than she
darted past him and in at the front door, which,
for an unusual thing, stood wide open.</p>

<p>“Papa! Grandmother! Where are you? I’m
so glad&mdash;I’m sorry&mdash;I lost it&mdash;I was lost, too,
and he’s&mdash;the loveliest great gray&mdash;Papa!
Papa Calthorp!”</p>

<p>Her father emerged from the library, looking
very pale and careworn; but she sprang into his
arms with such exuberant delight that a smile
rose to his lips. Then he clasped her close,&mdash;closer
than she had ever known him to do, and
his cheek felt the chill of hers. “Why, sweetheart,
how cold you are! Where have you
been?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear, Papa, dear? I said I had
been lost.”</p>

<p>Very speedily thereafter Steenie found herself
in bed. She didn’t quite comprehend it, and it
certainly was her first experience of going into
such retirement in the daytime; but one glance
at the child’s wet feet and shivering body had
alarmed Madam greatly.</p>

<p>“Right out of that warm climate into this,
and clad as she is! This way, Steenie, at once.
Oh, your shoes! The tracks on the carpet!”</p>

<p>“Here, darling, I’ll carry you;” and as directly
as if his eyes could see, Mr. Calthorp bore his little
girl to her own room and himself assisted in
tucking her into the thick blankets, while Mary
Jane fussed about with hot bricks and soap-stones,
and Madam Calthorp administered a dose
of sage-tea, whose aroma carried the father back
to the days of his own childhood.</p>

<p>When the excitement had somewhat subsided,
and Steenie had assured them over and over that
she was as “warm as a pepper-stew,” the house-mistress
sat down to listen to the tale which her
grandchild had, until then, vainly endeavored
to tell.</p>

<p>“First, I’m so sorry about your shawl. I took
it off, ’cause it was so warm; an’ I don’t know
where the place was. The fence is just the same,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind the shawl, Steenie; it is certain
to be returned. Somebody will find and recognize
it; but what is that about a horse?”</p>

<p>Holding fast to her father’s hand, Steenie gave
a graphic description of the runaway, and its result.
When she had finished, Madam sat in
a silence which was plainly that of a shocked
dismay. Finally she spoke.</p>

<p>“This is even worse than I feared. No such
accident must occur again. Steenie, before another
word is said, promise me that you will not
go into the street again without permission.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Mother!” interposed Mr. Calthorp,
earnestly. “Pardon my disputing your authority,
but that will not answer. Steenie has never
known restraint, and&mdash;but let us settle all this
at some other time.”</p>

<p>The lady sighed. She had her own ideas of how
a little girl should be brought up; but she felt
her old hands inadequate to the task. She had
been so peaceful and free! Why had this trial
been sent upon her? Gravely she arose and left
the room, and the relieved runaway went to sleep
to wake at the dinner hour with no worse feeling
about her than rebellion against being kept
in bed when there was “nothing the matter that
ever was.”</p>

<p>The immediate result of that morning’s adventure,
so far as Steenie was concerned, was a suitable
wardrobe. A dressmaker took up her abode
in the west chamber, and there the restless child
was imprisoned during a fortnight of bright days,
while birds sang invitations to her through the
windows, and the crocuses coaxed her with their
shining faces to “come out of doors and be
glad!”</p>

<p>But the only time she could command for that
was after the crocuses and the birds had gone to
sleep, and the dressmaker had stopped work for
the day.</p>

<p>“Why do I need so many things, dear grandmother?
I’m sure they’re pretty; but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Many, Steenie? I have never been an extravagant
woman, and I certainly shall not cultivate
the habit now. But there must be two
comfortable school-frocks and three or four thinner
ones; for I wish everything to be accomplished
at once that will be required during the
summer. There must be a simple dress for church
and a richer one for visiting; and&mdash;that is all.
I’m sure you are the first little girl I ever knew
who didn’t like handsome clothes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you haven’t known even me&mdash;that
way! For I like the frocks well enough, but not
the fixing of them. I stand up, ‘being fitted,’
till my feet ache like anything; and Miss Sessions’
knuckles have punched me all over black
and blue. She doesn’t mean it, of course; but
when she puts in a pin she jams against me like
I was her lap-board. And I wish needles hadn’t
eyes! ’Cause I ’most put mine out threading ’em.”</p>

<p>“Why, Steenie! I thought you were a contented
child! I have never heard you complain
of anything before.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you? Am I complaining? But&mdash;it’s&mdash;it’s&mdash;awfully,
awfully lonesome! I
wish Papa would come back! I can’t sleep
nights for wondering about his poor eyes; and
how long it will take the man to fix ’em.”</p>

<p>“There, there! That will do. Don’t allow
yourself to give way to habits of despondency.
Your father expected to be gone for two weeks,
and he has been for but for ten days. Maybe, if you
go down into the kitchen, you can see Mary Jane
get supper.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Steenie, choking back her emotion,
and turning toward the stairs, whence,
seeing her grandmother stoop to pick up a thread
from the carpet, she ran to save her the trouble,
and ended by throwing her arms about the silk-clad
shoulders and giving them a hearty squeeze.
“Oh! I do love you so, Grandmother!”</p>

<p>“Why, Steenie? Because of the new frocks
and pretty jackets?”</p>

<p>“Grandmother! How funny! ’Cause of
nothing at all only&mdash;’cause!”</p>

<p>At which senseless reason the giver of it
smiled merrily, and the recipient smiled almost
indulgently.</p>

<p>“Well, run now! To-morrow you will be at
school, and a new life will begin for you.”</p>

<p>“How? Am I not living now?”</p>

<p>“In one way, yes. But there is a world of
books to which your school training will open the
door. To me, that world is everything, or
was. I find&mdash;some other things&mdash;begin to
interest me now.”</p>

<p>“What things, Grandmother?”</p>

<p>“No matter, little questioner; but things
utterly different from any printed page.” When
Madam Calthorp said anything that Steenie did
not understand, the latter readily attributed it to
the lady’s great “intelligence,” which she had
now learned to call by its right name.</p>

<p>But, somehow, that little talk had set both
old and young hearts to lighter beating; and
Steenie departed kitchen-ward, feeling that
“watching Mary Jane” was something interesting,
even if it could not quite equal a race on the
sands with Tito.</p>

<p>But of that beloved animal she dared not
think often. It was apt to make a troublesome
“ache” come “in her throat,” and it “didn’t do
any good.”</p>

<p>On the following morning, feeling very curious
and happy, Steenie entered the primary department
of the great school for which Old Knollsboro
was famous. She did not know that girls
“going on eleven” usually disdained “primaries”
as far beneath them, and she wouldn’t
have cared if she had; but, at the first recess,
she was enlightened on the subject by a young
miss in braids, who remarked, patronizingly,
“Oh, you’re the new girl, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not new,&mdash;not very. I’m over ten.”</p>

<p>“What? I don’t mean new that way. You
just came.”</p>

<p>“No. I have been here ever so long. Grandmother
says ’bout three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel mad to go with the little
ones?”</p>

<p>“No. I think I like little ones best. I never
saw any ’bout my size ’cept Beatrice, and&mdash;and&mdash;you,”
concluded Steenie, stammering in her
confusion over saying something that even to
her untrained ears sounded “not just right.”</p>

<p>“My! Aren’t you polite! Well, what can
you expect, my mother says, of a girl that’s
lived in California amongst cow-boys.”</p>

<p>“Cow-boys are nicer&mdash;nicer than&mdash;nice! I
love them, every one!” cried this loyal Santa
Felisan.</p>

<p>“You’d ought to be ashamed!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because. Say, has Beatrice Courtenay
been to see you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Once.”</p>

<p>“You thought you did something smart, didn’t
you? Ma said it was disgraceful for a girl to
get talked about like you have been.”</p>

<p>Steenie stared in amazement, then bethought
herself of her grandmother’s parting advice: “Be
pleasant to all, as is natural to you; but do not
have much to say to any girl until you have
learned her name. I wish you to make only the
right friends, and I can tell you about all the
families&mdash;if not all the children&mdash;in town. It
is wise to select your playmates from households
of gentlewomen. ‘Even a child is known by the
company he keeps.’”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me your name, miss
girl?”</p>

<p>“It’s Annie Gibson. My father keeps a candy
store.”</p>

<p>“Does he? Why does that bell ring? Isn’t
the lady pretty who teaches me? She thinks I
read very well indeed, for&mdash;for&mdash;me.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! You’d ought to hear me! I’m in
the Fifth Reader. I speak pieces, examination
days. Your dress is awful nice and stylish. I
bet you didn’t have that made in your old California.
I bet your grandmother had to give it to
you.”</p>

<p>“Annie, you shouldn’t say ‘I bet.’ Grandmother
c’rected me, myself, for doing it. My
grandmother is a very in-tell-i-gent woman, my
father says, an’ I’m to watch out for the way
she talks; ’cause she never says anything ’nelegant.
But I think your frock is pretty, too. It’s
redder’n mine, an’ more ruffley, isn’t it? I
think you are very nice to look at. Your eyes
are black, aren’t they? And your hair is nice
an’ straight. An’ what beautiful big feet you
have, an’ hands! Why, your hands are a’most
twice as big’s mine!”</p>

<p>Poor Annie Gibson didn’t know whether to
laugh or “get mad;” but there was no doubting
the sincere and admiring curiosity with which
Steenie Calthorp examined this other specimen
of girlhood; but the final tones of the bell called
both away toward the house.</p>

<p>Which, however, Steenie did not enter. Her
attention had suddenly been attracted by a commotion
in the street, and everything new
appealed to her curiosity.</p>

<p>“My! I wonder what those boys are doing!
What&mdash;What&mdash;What!”</p>

<p>With a shriek of delight that penetrated the
building she was deserting, the child darted from
the enclosure,&mdash;through the crowd of grinning
boys straight to the cause of all their mirth.
“My Sutro! My Sutro! My own, ownest
Tito!”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> My angel! Is it thou? At
last&mdash;at last!”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>STEENIE AND TITO.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Sutro and Tito,
indeed!</p>

<p>The former
in the full glory
of his holiday
Mexican costume, looking a
little the worse for a long
journey; the latter in exuberant
spirits over his release
from the car which he
had occupied for nearly a
week, padded and luxurious
though it had been. The extravagant
caresses of one old
friend, and the pleading, loving neighings of the
other, were met by an ecstatic response, which
told how greatly they had been missed.</p>

<p>“Oh! How&mdash;Why&mdash;I’m so glad I shall&mdash;cry!”</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! We part no more, <i>mi niña</i>
[my little one].”</p>

<p>“But how could you come? You darlings!”</p>

<p>“How? Save on that horrible railway train,
<i>de veras</i>, indeed! But thy Tito suffered not at
all, he. Bob and the boys sent him to thee, their
Little Un; for, in verity, he was of no use to the
Lord of Plunkett, no. Not a saddle nor a bridle
would he endure, until to-day. And so&mdash;goes
thy Bob to the señor and says: ‘The Little Un’s
horse travels east to the Little Un, with old
Sutro, who will not live at San’ Felisa without
his heart’s dearest.’ And&mdash;here we are. <i>Caramba!</i>
Thou lookest fine, no? But&mdash;still&mdash;thou
wilt return with Sutro to the old <i>hacienda</i>,
wilt thou not, <i>mañana</i> [to-morrow, sometime]?”</p>

<p>“The very first <i>mañana</i> that ever I can!
But, go away, you boys! What do you want
with us?”</p>

<p>“A circus! A circus!” cried the gamins,
delighted at seeing Steenie now mounted behind
the old Spaniard, whose striking apparel reminded
them of nothing but the fascinating
entertainment just mentioned.</p>

<p>“It’s that horse girl!”</p>

<p>“It’s her that rode Beatrice Courtenay’s
runaway!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet all my alleys she does b’long to a
circus, an’ that’s another of ’em!”</p>

<p>“Say, Sissy, what show you skedaddle out
of? Give us the tip!”</p>

<p>“The tip, no? The whole of it, you miserables!”
Suiting the action to the word, Sutro
leaned sidewise from the saddle, and laid about
him hastily with his short riding-whip. This
had the effect of ridding them from immediate
persecution, and, taking advantage of this lull in
the attentions of the street boys, Steenie gave
Tito his word of command, and away they shot
at a pace to distance all pursuers.</p>

<p>Madam Calthorp looked up from her book as
the clattering of horse-hoofs fell on the gravel of
the path which led to her disused stable, and
could scarcely believe her own eyes for the story
they told her.</p>

<p>She was still trembling from the shock of her
surprise when Steenie bounded into her presence,
wild with excitement and radiantly glad. “O,
Grandmother&mdash;Grandmother! Who do you
think has come? Tito&mdash;Tito&mdash;Tito! My own
Tito! And that blessed old Sutro, who is as
old as old, but didn’t mind anything but staying
away from his <i>niña</i>! Come&mdash;come&mdash;quick&mdash;and
see them!”</p>

<p>She could not stand still, not one instant; but
around and around her grandmother’s chair she
danced, while that lady slowly rose, wondering
at herself for even this concession.</p>

<p>“This way! This way! To the&mdash;I s’pose it’s
the stable! And won’t Tito be glad to get into a
quiet stall once more? And the grass! Can he
roll on the cunning little lawn, Grandmother?”</p>

<p>“Steenie, silence. Be still for one moment.
What is all this? Who is ‘Tito,’ who ‘Sutro’?
Why are you not at school?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don’t know. I s’pose I forgot.
Sutro&mdash;is Sutro. Don’t you know I told
you ’bout him? He’s my body-servant, and as
old as anything. But such a rider! There’s
nobody in all San’ Felisa can beat him, ’cept
Kentucky Bob an’ some more. Bless his heart!
Bob’s, I mean. Bless everybody’s! For he’s
come all these long three thousand miles to bring
me my pretty piebald Tito. The Plunketty Lord
said he should always be mine, case I ever went
back; but those dear boys wouldn’t wait for
that&mdash;no! I s’pose they saw that Tito was
breaking his heart and s’posed I was mine; and
so they paid all the money for Tito’s ticket,
and hired him a beautiful cushioned horse-box,
and sent Sutro to take care of him till
he brought him safe to me. And&mdash;and&mdash;he’s&mdash;they’re
never going away any more till I go,
too. Oh, <i>hola</i>, <i>hola</i>! Aren’t you glad&mdash;glad&mdash;glad?”</p>

<p>If she were glad she did not so express herself;
nor did Madam Calthorp’s countenance exhibit
any emotion brighter than dismayed astonishment
as she followed this strange child out of
the room and out of the house, in order to be
presented to two more intruders.</p>

<p>“Sutro, Caballero Don Sutro Vives, this is my
beautiful Madam Grandmother. And Tito&mdash;my
sweet!”</p>

<p>“I have the honor to kiss thy feet, Señora,”
said the old Spaniard, bowing profoundly.</p>

<p>For a moment Madam regarded him with admiring
curiosity. As a “type” of that race which
she had read of in history, a race that was fast
dying out, he interested her, and for that reason
she was glad to see him; and the caballero,
lifting his eyes from the ground, beheld only the
pleasure, and did not question its cause. “The
Doña Steenie says truly, Madam; the Señora is
beautiful,&mdash;as the snows on the Sierras. May
the humblest of her slaves beg her gracious
favor?”</p>

<p>Such language was new to Old Knollsboro,
though to Steenie’s ears it was as familiar and as
meaningless as the ordinary salutations of the
day to other folk; and she interrupted any reply
which Madam might have made by seizing that
lady’s hand and placing it on Tito’s flowing mane.
“Isn’t it fine and white,&mdash;whiter and softer
than the freshest fleece ever sheared? And see
the pretty, pretty markings all over his body!
Lift your foot, my Tito. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four!
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four! Isn’t that
a fine action? And his haunches! See how
strong and shapely. And his lovely tail, set
straight and free! And his darling neck! Oh,
my Tito, I love you! I love you!”</p>

<p>Madam Calthorp was speechless. Not only
was she amazed, but she was touched. She had
never seen anything like this. It was as if a
twin had found its mate; and the exchange of
sentiment between the two young creatures was
too evident for even her untrained eyes to ignore.
Steenie was not one whit more glad than Tito;
nor did she express her emotion more clearly.
The animal’s velvet nostrils moved everywhere
about the curly head and bobbing shoulders of
his recovered mistress, with an exquisite gentleness
of touch she could not have believed possible
in “only a horse.” There was adoring delight
in the great brown eyes which followed Steenie’s
every motion, and seemed blind to all else; and
when Sutro had unfastened the stable door, the
loving pair went joyfully away together, her arm
about his neck, bent proudly to receive it.</p>

<p>“My-soul-I-declare!”</p>

<p>This ejaculation, in the harshest utterance of Mr.
Resolved Tubbs, broke in upon this pretty scene
with the force of an explosion. It cleared the
air of undue sentiment, and recalled Madam Calthorp
to a sense of her position and its consequences.
Here she had not only received these
unwelcome intruders, but allowed them to believe
that she was glad to do so! She must right the
mistake at once.</p>

<p>“Ahem, Mr. Sutro, I mean Vives, I think it
would be better to take that animal directly to
the livery stable. I do not keep a horse, and
should not be willing to let Steenie. As for yourself,
while your devotion is touching, I think you
can find more comfortable quarters at the village
than I can give you. This man&mdash;Tubbs, will
you show this old gentleman the way to the
American House?”</p>

<p>Considering the lumbago, Mr. Tubbs stepped
forward with amazing alacrity. He was quite
willing to prevent his small “world” being
“turned upside down” by this fresh consignment
from the far west. But his obliging readiness
fell powerless before the caballero’s obtuse serenity.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pardons, most charming Señora,
but whatever will serve my hostess serves me.
Old Sutro is not particular.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;gracious!” retorted Resolved, and began
an explanation which was cut short by Steenie’s
reappearance with the request: “Please get
me some alfalfa, or oats, or something for my
Tito’s dinner; will you, Mr. Tubbs?”</p>

<p>“Steenie, there is nothing for a horse to eat
here. I have not kept one in many years. The
last one was your father’s, before he left home.
This animal must be taken elsewhere for the
present.”</p>

<p>“Grandmother! My Tito? After so long,
long a journey? Oh, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>“But, my child, be reasonable. The stable
is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Xcuse my interrupting, but it’s just as nice
as nice. They’s a lovely box-stall, only wants
taking those old rubbishy things out of it; an’
places for everything. We can go to the shop
where you buy things for horses, and buy him
all he needs. Same’s you bought my clothes.
An’ then such fun! Won’t Papa be glad! And
Sutro&mdash;forgive me not thinking ’bout you, too.
Are you hungry, dear Sutro? You’re ’most
always, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Señorita! The food on the way was
not of Ellen’s sort. In verity, I would like a
dish of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A’most anything, no? Grandmother, may
Mary Jane cook Sutro some dinner?”</p>

<p>“Hm. It must be near the dinner-hour for
all of us; and you may invite your old friend for
this one meal.” The significance of the lady’s
tone was not lost upon her ancient servitor, Resolved,
but it was&mdash;wholly&mdash;upon the happy
unconsciousness of these two reunited comrades,
whom Madam Calthorp watched with growing
interest; even herself forgetting, as Steenie had
utterly forgotten, that there was such a thing as
school and its duties.</p>

<p>“She is a different creature! Vivacious, sparkling,
charming. And all for that queer old man
and queerer horse! Is it as my son has thought
and said,&mdash;that the key to the child’s nature is
love,&mdash;overflowing love? Well, there is, certainly,
no mistaking the love between those two
nor the want of it between these&mdash;two!” considered
the unwilling hostess, turning her eyes upon
the two old men, as Sutro and Resolved glared with
instant and mutual dislike upon each other.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that Tubbs is actually growing
fond of the child, and is jealous?”</p>

<p>It seemed so, strange as it was; for when
dinner was served, and Sutro, naturally, took his
place behind Steenie’s chair, the other ancient
worthy remarked with considerable sharpness:
“Ye kin set down, can’t ye?” and pointedly
pushed a chair back to designate where.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand thanks, my friend; when the
Señorita has finished,” answered Sutro, suavely.</p>

<p>“Sin-your-eet-her, hey? What heathen gibberish
is that, I’d like ter know? Thar’s yer place,
an ’thar ye kin set er go ’ithout,&mdash;uther one,”
retorted Tubbs, forgetting in his aversion to this
“furriner” the respect due to the occasion.</p>

<p>“<i>Luego</i> [presently].” With the sweetest of
smiles, old Vives, who had been watching Resolved’s
manner of service, deftly turned his
little lady’s plate, exactly as the other had done
Madam Calthorp’s.</p>

<p>When Mr. Tubbs passed to his mistress the
food which Mary Jane had carved, the stranger
anticipated a similar attention to Steenie. So
with everything; till even the house-mistress’s
dignity yielded to a smile, and the little girl
laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Why, you two funny men! What makes
you go snap&mdash;snap&mdash;with things, so? And
poor Mr. Resolved, if it’s your lumbago worse,
just let Sutro take care of Grandmother, too.
My Sutro can do everything beau-u-tifully; can’t
you, dear?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> It is music thou speakest, <i>carita</i>.”</p>

<p>“T-wu-ho!” With this indescribable snort
Mr. Tubbs retreated to the kitchen and threw
himself down recklessly in Mary Ann’s own
rocker. But the rocker was cushioned, and Resolved
was tired; and the combination revealed
the fact that even an enemy has his uses. “My-soul-I-declare!
If he wants ter trot round
waitin’ on younguns, let him trot! Ain’t no
law ag’in it, as I know of.”</p>

<p>“Ner ag’in your behavin’ like a great, cross
youngun yerself, if I do say so!” said Mary
Jane, dishing apple-fritters with a skilful hand.</p>

<p>“Ain’t cross. An’ if I be, ain’t it enough ter
make a critter a’most sw’ar? Here was we livin’
like pigs in clover; and in come Mr. Daniel an’
the gal. Now, ’s if that wa’n’t upsettin’ enough&mdash;piles
in a heathen Mexican an’ a calico horse
ter boot! I do say, an’ I mean it, folks does sometimes
get more o’ trouble ’n they desarve in this
world.”</p>

<p>“Calico horses is lucky. Hain’t you never
heerd that? I always wish when I see one, an’
that ain’t often. An’, though it does make a
pile o’ work, I&mdash;no, sir!&mdash;I ain’t a mite sorry ’t
Mr. Dan’l an’ Steenie come!”</p>

<p>“Ma-ry-Ja-ne!” Tubbs half rose from his
chair, in astonishment at his sister’s words.
“An’ you&mdash;a perfessor!”</p>

<p>“Perfessor from my youth up,” assented the
spinster, piously. “That’s why it’s borne in on
me ter witness fer the truth. I hated it&mdash;Here!
you Mr. Sutry! Jest fetch all them things out,
fust. Don’t leave anything on the table, savin’ the
bread an’ the salt. And&mdash;there ye be! Handy
as a womern, I do declare!&mdash;Yes, sir, I hated it
wuss ’n pisen. So ’t I couldn’t sleep, worryin’
’bout the victuals ter cook an’ the dishes ter wash,
an’ the hull job. An’ I knowed Madam hated it
even wusser. But now&mdash;mebbe it’s grace ’at’s
’gin me, an’ mebbe it’s only natur’; but that
little creetur has ’bout changed the hull outlook
o’ things. She jest acted as if I loved her the
terr’blest’t ever was, an’ fust I knowed&mdash;I did!
Thar wasn’t no holdin’ out ag’in them big innercent
eyes o’ her’n, a smilin’ so right inter a body
till a body can’t help smilin’ back. So&mdash;now
I’ve told it out, an’ I feel better. You b’lieve
my words, brother Resolved, an’ mark ’em well:
Thar’s a blessin’ come with poor Mr. Dan’l’s
comin’, an’ it’s took visible shape in that thar
child!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I swan!”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Ye needn’t swan’ nothin’. Madam’s
through. Come along an’ eat yer dinner. An’
remember ter let yer candle burn afore that poor,
yaller-skinned, heathen stranger, who, if he hain’t
got the grace o’ perfessorship has got it o’
perliteness.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, “professor” Tubbs arose and
followed Mary Jane into the dining-room, where
Sutro had already seated himself in the chair
designated by his new <i>confrère</i>, and was smiling
blandly kitchen-wards, when that person’s
bent figure darkened the doorway. But if
there was any spiritual light-shining or candle-burning,
it was not of a sort to impress the
Catholic Christian with the beauty of the Puritan
creed.</p>

<p>Alas! It was war from the beginning with
these two; and, though both were inwardly
conscious of their own blame in the matter, no
amount of self-abusive prayers on one side or
muttered Ave Marias on the other could ever
change the course of nature.</p>

<p>“Water won’t run up-hill; an’ folks ’at ’s
born contrary stays contrary. All you kin expect
is ter keep the peace,” said the shrewd
Mary Jane, and determined to make a bridge of
her own patience which should serve both sides
of the hostile camp.</p>

<p>After dinner the question of Tito again arose;
and, pending her son’s return, Madam compromised
her own judgment and sent off an order
for food and bedding sufficient for a few days’
need. “I’m growing very weak and indulgent,”
she said, apologetically, to Mary Jane. “But
this arrival was so unexpected, it may be as well
to await Daniel’s decision.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. An’ I do ’low you won’t be sorry.
She don’t ask ner tease fer nothin’; hain’t never
sence she come. ’Bout them books, even; I’ve
seen her a marchin’ back an’ forth, back an’
forth, a lookin’ through the glass at ’em that
longin’ ’at I’ve be’n a’most a mind ter open the
bookcases an’ show ’em to her. But, o’ course, I
didn’t; an’ she didn’t say ary word, ner even
look mad, only kinder hungry-like. ’Twould be
a pity not ter let her have her pony, seems ter
me. Mr. Sutry, he says she kin beat any circuser
’tever was. She’s rid’ ever sence she was a
baby; an’ them men out ter Californy&mdash;‘boys,’
she calls ’em&mdash;’d a never let her come east in
the world if it hadn’t a be’n fer her pa’s eyes.
When’s he comin’ home, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Soon, I hope. And that he will be reassured
concerning his dreaded blindness. It cannot be
that a Calthorp&mdash;such a strong, healthy, handsome
man he is, Mary Jane&mdash;should suffer such
a physical blemish!”</p>

<p>In that sentence spoke one of Madam Calthorp’s
strongest prejudices. Against imperfection
of any sort her proud heart rebelled. Her
own physique was faultless. She wore her years
and her white hairs as royally as a queen her
ermine mantle. She had always prayed that she
might die thus, in her full vigor, before any
mortal weakness touched her; and her feeling of
this sort extended to all belonging to her. If
her son died, she would mourn him; but if he
lived, a helpless wreck, she dared not contemplate
the prospect.</p>

<p>“No, it don’t ’pear so; but the ‘don’t ’pear
so-s’ are gen’ally what happens; an’ though I
hate ter say it, I think you’d oughter know that
Mr. Dan’l went away a’most convicted in his
own mind ’at he wouldn’t never see no more o’
this mortal speer ’an he saw then.”</p>

<p>“Mary Jane! But you are not always a true
prophet.”</p>

<p>“An’ I hope, with all that’s in me, ’at I ain’t
now!”</p>

<p>But&mdash;she was. An attendant brought Daniel
Calthorp home that night; and the first glance
which his mother cast upon his face disclosed
that his last hope of restored sight had gone out
from it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">There was no
evading the fact
that a terrible
misfortune had
fallen upon the
Calthorp household;
and, for a time, this
great sorrow excluded
every other thought.</p>

<p>But they were all brave-hearted,
having that one
quality in common; and so,
even while suffering most acutely, Madam found
that the feeling she had experienced in regard
to her son’s blindness faded in the light of the
great pity which now filled her soul. She had
feared that she could never bear to look upon
him and witness his helplessness; but, instead of
this being the case, she found herself watching
him in silent admiration for the fortitude he displayed,
and growing even prouder than before.</p>

<p>“Well. Blind or seeing, he is still&mdash;a man!
Able to support his own courage, and that of
those who lean upon him! And how beautiful
is Steenie’s tenderness! She seems to understand
that he wishes to do everything for himself
which he can do; but her own bright eyes watch
constantly to aid him in those he cannot.”</p>

<p>Mary Jane, observing her mistress’s face, and
following the direction of her eyes, smiled, well
pleased. Then she stole away to remark to
Resolved: “You said we might ’bout as well gin
up, when Mr. Dan’l come home that night an’ laid
his goggles off, ’cause they wasn’t no more use a
pertectin’ stun blindness no longer; but&mdash;they’s
some kinds o’ onseeingness wuss’n ever ailded
mortal eyes. An’ that’s sperritooal. Thar was
Madam, a nussin’ up wrath ag’in the day o’ jedgment,
jest ’cause her only had married somebody
’t she hadn’t picked out fer him; an’ him a cl’arin’
out ter Californy with his wife, an’ a buryin’ her
thar; an’ a comin’ back home this way he is. But
I tell ye, brother Resolved, it was the plain doin’s
of the Lord, er my name ain’t Tubbs!”</p>

<p>“Well, mebbe. I mean&mdash;o’ course. I ain’t
a goin’ back on my perfession; but some folks
has got a terr’ble gift o’ makin’ sunthin’ out o’
nothin’. Didn’t uset ter be yer way ter call bad
good; but, my-soul-I-declare! Ain’t no makin’
ye out, now-a-days, ye’ve growed that weak-minded
an’ soft-spoke. Howsomever, one thing
ye can’t turn ner twist inter no great hilarity:
an’ that’s that pesky Mexicer.”</p>

<p>“I should like ter know why not? Ain’t he jest
like a shadder ter Mr. Dan’l? If that poor deluded
popist critter ain’t ’arnin’ his board an’ keep, I
know some other folks ’at ain’t wuth their salt.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. From the soond o’ that, I conclude ’at
thar’s <i>some</i>&mdash;o’ the ’riginal Mary Jane left, arter
all!” retorted the other, and doddered away.</p>

<p>It had seemed providential, indeed, that Sutro
Vives&mdash;old fellow though he was&mdash;had come
to them when he did. With the profound love
which he had always felt for little Steenie, he
now turned to Steenie’s father; and his wonderful
vitality enabled him to discharge with perfect
ease tasks which would have fallen very heavily
upon poor Resolved Tubbs.</p>

<p>Another two weeks had passed; and they had
all, in a measure, become accustomed to Mr. Calthorp’s
affliction, and to the coming of the “four
Westerners,”&mdash;as Mary Jane called the three human
visitors and the equine one,&mdash;when Steenie
came home from school a picture of childish
distress.</p>

<p>“I can’t&mdash;can’t&mdash;can’t&mdash;go to that horrid
school! Never no more, never!” with which
exclamation she burrowed into the nest her
father’s arms made for her, and hid her tearful
face on his breast.</p>

<p>He waited until her sobs had subsided, and
then inquired: “Why not, darling?”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;oh, ’cause&mdash;I hate it! Maybe
that’s bad, but I do. The children go ‘buz-z,
buz-z’ over their books; and it’s hot; and I
can’t breathe, a’most; and, oh, Papa, I want
to go home!”</p>

<p>“My little one, I shall have to forbid your
‘boys’ writing to you, if their letters make
you homesick.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. It isn’t, really, truly. But&mdash;am
I a ‘runaway circuser,’ Papa, dear?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. Certainly not. Why should you
need contradiction of such a silly charge?”</p>

<p>“’Cause that’s what they all call me&mdash;’most
every one. An’ they say: ‘Why won’t you give
us a ride on your old Spot-back, Californy!’
And: ‘She’s the girl ’at ’s only in the Primary!
’Cause she’s brought up in a stable;’ an’
such heaps o’ mean things that I feel&mdash;I
feel’s if I should suff’cate. Need I go, Papa,
dearest?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell yet. Let us talk it over with
Grandmother. Rather, I will do that, and you do
what is far more to your liking and better for
you,&mdash;wash away your tears, find Sutro, and tell
him he may go for a horse at the livery-stable;
then jump on Tito’s back and ride your troubles
away.”</p>

<p>When obedience is happiness, it is always
prompt; but even happiness has its drawbacks.
It was this very riding on the piebald horse
which had excited the envy and malice of a
few of Old Knollsboro small folks. The majority
of Steenie’s school-fellows were full of
an unexpressed admiration for her wonderful
horsemanship as exhibited in the&mdash;to her quiet&mdash;rides
through the village streets; but she was
not the first person who has forgotten the flavor
of the grapes in the sting of the wasp hidden
among them,&mdash;although, heretofore, her sunny
nature had risen above her annoyances with its
own gay rebound.</p>

<p>Now, when she had ridden out of the yard, and
the merry tones of her farewell had satisfied her
father’s ear that all was well for the present,
he went “to talk it over,” as he had promised,
with the mother, whom he now consulted in all
things.</p>

<p>“Well, Daniel, this is very strange! It seems
like a Providence. I have observed Steenie
closely; and I am sorry to say that the school
plan has not worked as successfully as I had
hoped. She doesn’t know what is the matter;
but I do. It is the unwonted confinement. She
asked Mary Jane what a prison was like; and
when it was described, said: ‘Oh, I thought,
maybe, it was like our school-house.’ It is
really very opportune.”</p>

<p>“But what, Mother? I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“This morning’s call from Mrs. Courtenay.
She says the Judge was so pleased with Steenie,
and that Beatrice talks so much about her, they
beg me to allow our little girl to go to Rookwood
every day and share their child’s instruction and
amusement. That two such lonely only children
can do each other a deal of good. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with all my heart. If you approve.”</p>

<p>“It does seem an admirable arrangement. The
Judge has always expressed his deep obligation to
your father for assistance when his own prospects
were poor; and I can understand a proud man’s
desire to render some recognition of this ‘claim,’&mdash;though
such, I am sure, I have never felt it.
Steenie will have only the most helpful surroundings
at Rookwood; and she will be fully appreciated.
I am glad, very glad.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mother! Your voice sounds as if you&mdash;actually&mdash;loved
my little one.”</p>

<p>“I do, my son.”</p>

<p>“And have you quite forgiven her likeness to
her mother?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. Then Daniel
Calthorp felt his mother’s kiss upon his cheek,
and, in that rare caress, died from both hearts
all bitter memories.</p>

<p>Mary Jane witnessed this little incident through
a crack in the door. Alas, Mary Jane was a
“mortal woman!” Then she stole away with
misty eyes,&mdash;misty, perhaps, from the strain of
peeping,&mdash;murmuring piously: “And a little
child shall lead ’em.”</p>

<p>But her piety did not prevent her being the
first to meet Steenie on her return from the ride,
and imparting the intelligence which was the result
of Mrs. Courtenay’s visit, instead of leaving
that pleasant business to those whose own it
really was.</p>

<p>“You ain’t never a goin’ back to no more
prisony-school, at all, Steenie Calthorp!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;not? Will Papa let me stay home
every day?”</p>

<p>“No. But trot along an’ hear. I ain’t a
goin’ ter take the good news out o’ nobody’s
mouth, I guess!”</p>

<p>For once, neglecting to care for her play-fellow,
Tito, Steenie bounded in-doors, eager to
have Mary Jane’s statement confirmed; which
being done, her pleasure knew no limits.</p>

<p>“Why, Papa Calthorp! It’ll be a’most the
same as San’ Felisa! They’s a great big house,
forty times bigger’n this, an’ a great big grass all
round it; an’ trees, an’ flower-beds, an’ hammocks,
an’&mdash;an’&mdash;things! And Sutro must
go, too; an’ I’ll ride Tito. An’ sometimes, maybe,
the Judge’ll let me go into the fields where
the horses are. I’ve seen them, dozens of them&mdash;beauties&mdash;corralled,
I mean paddocked, in
cute little places with green fences around them,
an’ a reg’lar shed for them to go under when it
rains. Just like some o’ the girls play ‘house’
at recess. Oh, do you s’pose he will?”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it. Especially as he loves
horses almost as well as you, and sympathy of
tastes makes ready friendships. I foresee a very
happy road to learning for you, my Steenie.”</p>

<p>With this assurance in her ears, the child went
gayly away on Tito’s back toward Rookwood,
with Sutro walking beside her at a pace which
Resolved Tubbs could never have equalled, even
in his youth.</p>

<p>“Oh, Steenie, how glad I am!” cried Beatrice,
for welcome. “Mama says we are to have our
lessons out of doors; ’cause it’s good for me, an’
what you’re used to, as well.”</p>

<p>“Only I never had lessons at all, till I came to
Old Knollsboro! But just learned to read an’
write a little. An’ do you think your father will
ever let me go to see his horses?”</p>

<p>“I b’lieve you care more for them than for
anything! You funny girl!” answered Beatrice,
reprovingly. “You’re just the same as he is; an’
Mama says horses are to my father what play-hour
is to school-boys. I don’t know ’xactly what
she means&mdash;but&mdash;he loves them, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Course he does. He couldn’t help it, could
he?”</p>

<p>“Mama can help it. She says she ’xpects
some of us’ll get killed; ’specially with Diablo,
that ’xpensive colt. He isn’t anything&mdash;yet;
never had anything on him, even a halter; but
Papa says, ‘he must be broken, if he scours the
country to find somebody brave enough to do
it!’”</p>

<p>“Diablo? Oh, he’s the one ’at ’most killed
the groom, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. An’ he’s kicked a whole lot of folks.
He’s out in his paddock all alone; and the men
just give him food and water, an’ let him stay
there. Mama says that he ought to be shot, and
then he couldn’t hurt anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Why! How dreadful!”</p>

<p>“What? To hurt folks?”</p>

<p>“To shoot a beautiful fellow like Diablo.
I’ve looked at him over the fence, when I’ve
been riding with Sutro; and he is the finest
horse in Old Knollsboro.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s the finest one I’ve seen here, yet.
He has better points, even, than Gray Monarch,
Kentucky Bob’s thoroughbred.”</p>

<p>“My! That’s what Papa calls him: thoroughbred;
an’ says when he’s trained he’ll be su-perb.
But I’d like to know who’ll do it. Say. Is
that old man coming to school too? Who is he?
Isn’t he queer? He’s as wizzly-up as can be;
but he makes me think of grasshoppers, he’s so
awful jumpy an’ quick.”</p>

<p>Steenie laughed. “He’s my body-servant, he
says; but he’s a real ’ristocratic. He’s a Californian,
like they used to be, and a caballero. But
after my mother died, he gave up everything but
taking care of me. He’s a perfect darling.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” asked Beatrice, doubtfully. “He
doesn’t look very&mdash;very pretty; but, I mean
he’s beautiful, of course, only&mdash;here’s Ma’amselle!
Now for b-a-ba k-e-r-ker, baker; p-a-pa
pay-e-r, I mean p-e-r-per. Do you like to
spell?”</p>

<p>“No. It makes me awful dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Me, too. But ’rithmetic’s more worser.
Never mind. The quicker we get done, the
quicker recess’ll come. I think recess is the
nicest part of studying, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Steenie, with conviction.
“Why, look there! There’s my Sutro talking
to your father! And they’re walking away
toward&mdash;oh!&mdash;do&mdash;you b’lieve they’ll go to
the horse fields without us?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose they will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>At which tone of regret, Beatrice said, kindly,
“You’re the queerest girl! But I’ll ask Papa
to let us go, recess-time. Papa! Papa!”</p>

<p>The Judge turned about and waited while the
children ran up to him. “Well, little folks!
What now? How could you tear yourselves
away from your dear books? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Now, Papa, please don’t tease! I’m sure
you wouldn’t like to have a whole line of hard,
two-syllabled words to learn, and rows and rows
of dazzly figures to add up, would you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly should not; on such a morning
as this, too. But if I were a little girl, two little
girls, I’d go at those words and figures ‘slap
bang!’ And I’d get them all tucked away
inside of my cranium, so tight and sure that
Ma’amselle would be obliged to say: ‘Really,
young ladies, <i>tres bien</i>! and I will compensate
you for your so hard labor, and give you leave
at eleven of the clock, precisely, to go to the
library of the father and look in.’”</p>

<p>“And, what then? What then, Papa?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, peanuts; maybe, horses. Different
tastes need different rewards.”</p>

<p>To Steenie this was not as intelligible as to
Beatrice, who readily translated for her new
friend’s benefit Judge Courtenay’s meaning,
which was: that he evidently wished to be let
alone then; but that if they were studious they
might leave off lessons at eleven o’clock, and
come to the library, when he would take them to
see the horses. “If anybody cares about those
old things!”</p>

<p>Steenie cared so very much that she infected
Beatrice with her own feeling; and her few
weeks at a “really school” had been of such use
to her, that once her books were opened, she
allowed herself no respite till she had conquered
the tasks set before her.</p>

<p>Which good example was, also, infectious to
the untrained Beatrice, who surprised and
pleased Ma’amselle by her sudden attention to
duty.</p>

<p>It is true that bright glances were occasionally
darted back and forth, and signs exchanged to
mark the progress of learning on either side; but,
in spite of this, when eleven o’clock came they
not only had done their work with satisfaction
to their teacher, but with real pleasure to themselves,&mdash;a
cause of considerable astonishment,
also.</p>

<p>“Now, for Papa and fun! My father’s a
awful jolly man. You can’t ’most gen’ally tell
if he’s teasing or earnest. But&mdash;he’s nice.”</p>

<p>“So’s mine. I guess fathers are always nice,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, not always. I know a father ’at whips
his girl. With a whip, like you do horses,”
asserted Beatrice, gravely.</p>

<p>“I never&mdash;whip horses’ Never! I wouldn’t
be so cruel!”</p>

<p>“My&mdash;sake! Why, are you ‘mad?’ Why
shouldn’t you whip ’em? Everybody does.”</p>

<p>“They don’t at Santa Felisa. I’ve seen folks
do it here, though; till I’ve had to run away an’
cry. I think it’s puf-fect-ly dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Why, Steenie Calthorp! You are the veriest
oddest one! My Papa’ll laugh at you. Pshaw!
He whips horses himself; an’ he’s a Judge,&mdash;a
Judge-of-the-Supreme-Court! If you know what
that is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. And I don’t care if he is, he
oughtn’t to. Bob says so, an’ Bob knows. He
says it’s ruiny to any poor thing to do it. Once
he caught a vaquero doing it to one of the Plunketty
man’s ploughers; and he just snatched the
rawhide out of the fellow’s hand, and gave it to
the fellow himself! Just as he was hurting the
horse. I tell you, wasn’t he mad? And didn’t
he jump around lively?”</p>

<p>“I should s’pose he did.”</p>

<p>“And Bob says: ‘Now you know how ’tis
yourself!’ and that vaquero could be trusted anywhere
after that. Only once he tried to shoot
Bob; so Bob had to lick him again, an’&mdash;that
settled it.”</p>

<p>“I should s’pose it did!” quoted an amused
voice, and Judge Courtenay’s hand rested lightly
on Steenie’s curly head. “You see I was tired
waiting for eleven o’clock, because that old señor
of yours has promised me a treat, too; so I came
out to meet you on the path from your summer-house
school-room.”</p>

<p>“How nice! What is it, Papa?”</p>

<p>“This little girl is to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“I? Why, what can a little girl like me do
for a big man like you?” asked Steenie, in eager
wonder.</p>

<p>“Show me how Kentucky Bob tackles an
unbroken colt.”</p>

<p>An instant’s critical scrutiny of the genial face
before her convinced Steenie that the words were
“earnest,” not “fun;” still&mdash;she could hardly
believe her own vision. “Do you really, truly
mean it?”</p>

<p>“I really, truly do. If you are not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid? My! I couldn’t be afraid of a
horse, could I? I love them so; and my father
says that they know it, ’stinctively.”</p>

<p>“Instinctively. Well&mdash;the old caballero’s
stories seem almost incredible; but now is your
chance to prove them true,” responded Diablo’s
owner, studying, in his turn, very critically the
animated face of the little girl beside him. He
did not at all believe any of the “yarns” which
Sutro had “spun” to him during their ramble
over the horse-farm; but he had immensely
enjoyed the boastful eloquence of one whom he
considered a “crack-brained old man;” and he
did not seriously intend allowing Steenie to approach
nearer than a safe distance of the beautiful
colt with the unsubdued will. But he
thought it would give her a pleasure to watch
Diablo over the paling; and he anticipated great
amusement, also, in watching Vives “back down”
when once brought face to face with fact,&mdash;fact
in the shape of a “vicious” four-year-old
whom the best horse-trainers had, as yet, been
unable to reduce to submission.</p>

<p>But he hadn’t counted at all upon the perfect
honesty and credulity of “the Little Lady of the
Horse,” nor her own proud acceptance of the
title which her adoring Santa Felisans had given
their “Little Un;” else what followed then
would never have happened.</p>

<p>As they came to the paddock, and looked over
the paling, Diablo’s owner pointed him out as:
“The handsome brute! There he is. As powerful
and wicked as his name denotes. Locked up
in those shapely limbs is a mint of money,&mdash;that
nobody dares conquer for me. A fine animal, eh?”</p>

<p>“He’s perfect! Oh, you beauty, you darling!”</p>

<p>Diablo stood at the extreme end of his paddock,
head up, eyes flashing, every nerve quivering
at sound of human voices. Of late, many
attempts had been made to “break him;” each
resulting in fresh torment to himself, and failure
to his would-be conquerors. Already he had
learned to distrust humanity, and to watch against
its assaults.</p>

<p>“Your lariat, Sutro,” whispered Steenie,
eagerly. And from his capacious pocket the
caballero drew a fine silken cord which he always
carried, and silently gave it to her.</p>

<p>The Judge’s attention had been diverted, for
an instant, but was recalled by a swish of flying
draperies, and Beatrice’s low cry: “My&mdash;sake!”</p>

<p>Steenie had leaped over the fence, and was
swiftly proceeding down the field, with the
springing step of one who merrily goes to meet
a friend.</p>

<p>“Merciful powers! Steen&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Sutro’s hand was firmly placed over Judge
Courtenay’s lips. “Ten thousand pardons! Speak
not&mdash;move not. Her safety and success depend
on silence,” whispered the caballero, impressively.</p>

<p>“Her success!” Strong man though he was,
Diablo’s owner turned faint, and he shut his eyes
in horror at this terrible result of his own idle
jesting.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">However, the
Judge quickly
aroused from the
inaction his terror
had caused, and, leaping
over the paling,
would have followed
this childish horse
“breaker,” had he
been allowed. But
Sutro sprang forward
almost as instantly,
leaned over the rails, and, with all the force of
his iron muscles, clasped his long arms around
the other’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> I tell thee&mdash;no! Thou shalt not!
Wouldst see her killed before thy very eyes?”</p>

<p>In a whisper, equally hoarse, the pinioned victim
of the Spaniard’s embrace retorted: “No!
For that reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Move not, hand nor foot! Watch. She is
safe. I swear it. She has a magic. I know not&mdash;she
calls it love.”</p>

<p>Magic! It seemed so. Half way down the
field Steenie slackened her pace, began to sing
softly, bits and snatches of melodies ended almost
in the same breath, and to stop and pluck
at the buttercup and clover blooms, here or there.
She had the lariat loosely about her wrist; but
she paid no attention to Diablo, who stood, like
a beautiful statue, regarding the intrusion.</p>

<p>By slow degrees she made her way to a low-branched
oak-tree standing at one side the paddock,
not far from the colt’s own position, and,
with the gentlest of motions, raised herself to
its broad limb.</p>

<p>Diablo was now obliged to turn his head in
order to watch her, but otherwise he did not stir;
and, observing this, Judge Courtenay’s heart beat
a trifle more naturally.</p>

<p>“Loose your arms, señor; I shall not startle
her now.”</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>Si?</i> Thou beholdest then that we spoke
the truth? In one half-hour my Little Un will
come to thee leading the beast by the forelock.
Thou wilt see.”</p>

<p>“Hang the beast! That she comes out alive&mdash;unhurt&mdash;is
all I care!”</p>

<p>“In verity she will do that. She will do a
miracle. Thou shalt see.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you are not afraid? I
thought you called her your ‘heart’s dearest’!”</p>

<p>“<i>En verdad.</i> She is the whole world to Sutro
Vives. But I am not afraid, I. She is all love,
all innocence, all fearlessness. She would win
over the Evil One himself, I believe, if she could
meet him!”</p>

<p>“She certainly has a chance now to try!”
groaned Diablo’s owner, too anxious to be greatly
amused by Sutro’s extravagance of language,
and holding himself ready to rush forward to the
child’s aid at the first ugly movement on the
animal’s part.</p>

<p>Timid Beatrice stood upon the lower round of
the fence, scarcely breathing in the fascination
of her fear; yet it was her eyes which interpreted
the first overture between those two out
there in the paddock. “See! She’s laid her
head down on the branch an’ pertends she’s going
to sleep; and I can hear her&mdash;I surely can&mdash;singing
soft, soft, kind of loving-y like. And now&mdash;he’s
moving&mdash;but slow&mdash;as anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am watching.” Neither voice raised
above a whisper.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;look now! He’s a walking up to her;
curious like, isn’t he? He’s&mdash;see him!”</p>

<p>Intently they gazed upon the pantomime.
Steenie lay on her leafy perch, one little foot
dangling and swinging lazily back and forth, her
blue eyes turned caressingly, almost imploringly,
upon Diablo, as if beseeching him to come to
her.</p>

<p>Her own description, afterward, was: “I just
thought <i>at</i> him as hard as ever I could. I
wouldn’t think of anything else, only that I did
love him, and was sorry he didn’t make friends
with his wanted-to-be friends, and I wanted he
should know ’bout it. And by-and-by, I s’pose
my thought hit his somewhere,&mdash;as Bob believes,&mdash;and
then&mdash;it was done. He just came closer
an’ closer; an’ by-an’-by he stretched out his
pretty nose and smelled of my foot. Then he
waited a minute, an’ I didn’t even wink, but just
kept on saying, inside of me: ‘Don’t you see I
love you? Don’t you know I love you?’”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon he sniffed at my hand in my lap;
and then he ate the clover blossoms; an’ then
he let me move one finger a little bit&mdash;though
he jumped at that. Afterwards, I could move
my whole hand, and smooth his face, that was
soft as satin. When I could coax his head down
to mine, so I could talk into his ears, I had no
more to do. I remembered everything Bob taught
me; and when I knew he was all right, and
wasn’t afraid any more, I let him smell of the
lariat, and fuss with it ’s long as he liked. Then
I made a slip-halter,&mdash;Bob’s way,&mdash;an’ that’s
all.”</p>

<p>That was all, perhaps, but it was marvellous in
Judge Courtenay’s eyes; while those of old Sutro
shone with fond pride.</p>

<p id="Page_152">“I told thee so, señor! See&mdash;she is leading
him as gentle as a lamb. Come, little señorita,
let us move back a space, and leave him to be
presented to one at a time. The master first, as
is right it should be.”</p>

<p>“Well!” ejaculated that gentleman, left in the
paddock, regarding with growing astonishment
the small figure which approached, leading Diablo
by his silken thrall, and with one arm thrown
upward upon his neck. “You are the most wonderful
child in the United States!”</p>

<p>Steenie smiled, and her eyes shone, but not
from vanity at this unbounded praise. She had
been hearing just such exclamations all her life
from her beloved, outspoken Santa Felisans, and
she knew that they came only from a mutual
love. But she was proud of her new conquest;
and she led Diablo close to his master, and held
out the end of the cord for the Judge to take.
“If you are just gentle with him, sir, he’ll
behave beautifully. He’s been frightened; that’s
all.”</p>

<p>He was frightened still, and, at the first motion
of his owner’s extended hand, drew backward,
nervously.</p>

<p>“Frightened! If ever I saw ugliness in a
brute, I see it in him now. Observe his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, sir, please! You don’t
understand. ’Xcuse me, but I’m sure you don’t.
Bob says a fine horse is all ‘nerves,’ an’ the ’most
sensitive thing in creation.’ He says folks ought
to treat ’em like babies; ’cause they feel things
more. Softly, my pretty one! Don’t you be
afraid. Steenie’ll let nobody hurt you&mdash;not a
body&mdash;even him!”</p>

<p>“Hm-m!”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s whipped him sometime, or struck
him cruelly.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they? He’s acted like a
villain.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d been here! He wouldn’t then&mdash;’cause
I know. See. He’s all gentle now. You
may put your hand on his nose; but it must be
kind&mdash;kind&mdash;’cause that’s the way.”</p>

<p>Diablo did permit his master to fondle him;
and at the first touch of the delicate nostrils all
the Judge’s love for horse-flesh sprang to the
front, and with it a subtler appreciation of
horse-nature than he had ever before known.
“Poor fellow! Is it so? Are you not really
vicious?&mdash;then I’ll not part with you.”</p>

<p>“Part with him? Why, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought he would be useless to us.
I bought him for a carriage horse, to match that
other colt, Brown Bess; but, while she is breaking
in like a kitten, he has resisted everybody.
I think he will again&mdash;after you go away from
him.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t go away. Oh, wait a moment!
I’ve thought of something. S’posin’ you teach
Diablo to be your very own, ownest horse;
s’posin’ you don’t let any grooms or anybody do
anything for him but just you, yourself! You
could make him as smart as Tito, maybe.”</p>

<p>“‘Maybe’? Is Tito so brilliant, then?”
asked the Judge, smiling, and greatly delighted
that Diablo now stood quietly beside them, nibbling
at the grass or sniffing about Steenie’s
curly head, without resenting their presence or
voices. Sutro and Beatrice had also drawn
near and leaned against the paling to hear what
the others were saying.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;he doesn’t&mdash;shine. That’s ‘brilliant,’
isn’t it? But he’s awful ’telligy&mdash;I
mean intelligent. Bob says, ‘He’s the brainiest
horse he’s ’quainted with, an’ sweetest tempered
to boot.’ He knows every single word I say to
him; and if he can’t talk much with his tongue,
he does with his actions an’ his eyes. He drives
without reins, an’ he waltzes&mdash;beau-u-tifully!
An’ he limps, an’ ‘goes it blind,’ an’ does the
cutestest things you ever saw a horse do. Oh,
won’t you let Diablo be just as clever? Either
for your own self or Beatrice? Wouldn’t you
like Diablo for your very own, Beatrice?”</p>

<p>“No; I should not,” answered that young
person, decisively.</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind to try your notion, little
one! There’s no fool like an old fool, they say;
and, maybe, I shall do better at horse-training
than at law. It’s a step upwards, too, from the
‘bench’ to the saddle! But&mdash;I confess I’m
very ignorant. The ‘breaking’ of my horses
has always been left to professional trainers. I
have, heretofore, been perfectly satisfied to accept
results only.”</p>

<p>“It seems perfectly funny to hear ’bout ‘breaking’
horses like they were dishes. Bob says it’s
a wrong word, an’ it’s ’sponsible for more suffering
to the poor things ’an any other word in the
language.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Who is this oracle, ‘Bob’?”</p>

<p>Steenie explained, and the Judge was so interested
that he exclaimed: “I wonder if I couldn’t
induce him to come out here and take care of
my stock-farm?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Steenie; “but I don’t
guess so. He says there isn’t room enough for
his lungs out East. He needs a great deal of
breathin’ space.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;Bob or no Bob&mdash;will you give an
old man like me a few lessons in horse-break&mdash;What
word shall I use?”</p>

<p>“It’s teaching,&mdash;just teaching ’em. Like
Beatrice an’ I go to school. It’s funny for me
to tell you things, isn’t it? ’Cause my grandmother
thinks you’re a&mdash;what did she call it!
A very wonderful magician&mdash;no, lo-gician; and
when I asked her what that was, she said maybe
I could understand ‘smart’ better.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Now, when shall our next
lesson be?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;that ever is. ’Cause
it doesn’t do to let Diablo forget us. He’s same
as babies yet. He hasn’t learned to remember.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then; and I am greatly indebted
to you. I believe&mdash;with both halves of my
mind, now&mdash;I will decide to act wholly upon
your suggestion, and see what comes of it. I
will train him for myself, alone. I shall be at
home, hereafter, for some weeks; and the opportunity
is mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am! Do you hear that,
Diablo, darling? You’re going to be nobody’s
horse but just this kind, kind man’s! You’re
never to be whipped, nor loaded, nor over-driven,
nor checked-back, nor strapped-down, nor anything
horrid like these queer Old Knollsboro
folks do to horses!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on! I have not promised any
of these ‘thousand and one’ things, little lady!
I shall want him to be useful.”</p>

<p>“Of course, and that’s why you won’t do
them. I saw some poor horses on the street
yesterday. They were before a big carriage, as
heavy, as heavy! And they had ugly straps to
hold their poor heads up&mdash;this way! Till their
throats ached so they couldn’t breathe, hardly.
Not like you help them with a strap when they’re
racing, so the wind won’t choke in their ‘pipes,’&mdash;’cause
that isn’t bad, just for the little minute
they have ’em so; but these were all crooked
back, terr’ble, so they couldn’t see, only a
little way up toward the sky. They had a
mis’able action; ’cause they had ‘blinders’ on,
besides, and all they dared to do was just step
straight up an’ down, up an’ down, fear they’d
hurt themselves. The coachman was lashing
them to make them go,&mdash;’cause his carriage
folks seemed in a hurry; an’ I should have
laughed at him, if I hadn’t had to cry for them&mdash;the
horses. I couldn’t help thinking ’bout
’em when I went to bed; an’ my father says ‘It’s
ign’rant cruelty,’ an’ ‘if the folks understood
horses’ feelings, like they’d ought to, why everybody’d
be gladder.’”</p>

<p>“Humph! You’re a very close observer. And
now, shall I lift you over the fence?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I’m going to walk once
around the paddock with Diablo, and ’xplain to
him ’bout our having to go, and our coming back
to-morrow, an’ everything. You can bid him
good-by, if you want to.”</p>

<p>“May I, indeed? How shall I do it?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;same’s folks. Same’s me. Say,
‘Good-morning, Diablo; pleased to make your
’quaintance,’ or anything nicey sounding an’
p’lite. He knows, Diablo does. An’ you want
him brought up like a gentleman’s horse, don’t
you? So he’ll understand when folks use good
language, an’ not what Papa calls ‘ruffian talk.’
He knows, Diablo does. See here? See that
fine head, broad as anything above the eyes?
That’s ’cause it’s full of brains; an’ brains are
where folks think an’ know things. If he hadn’t
have had a good head, he wouldn’t have understood
me so soon, first off. He looks as if he
might be as clever as Tito, ’most.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Diablo. I am sincerely delighted
to make friends with you,” said Judge
Courtenay, very gravely, though with a twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>But Steenie did not care for the twinkle, only
laughed in return; and, by her hand upon his
face forcing the colt’s head down, she gently
grasped his forelock and bent it still lower.
“Bow p’litely, dear Diablo, ’cause you’d ought
to.” Then she walked away as she had come,
with her arm upon his shoulder, and his light
leading-string held carelessly in her other hand.</p>

<p>The Judge climbed back over the paling, and,
catching sight of Sutro’s exultant face, laughed
and pulled out his watch. “Well, old fellow!
You’re a pretty good prophet! Five minutes
past time, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> More than that since she brought
him up to thee with the lariat round his nozzle,
no?”</p>

<p>“Beaten&mdash;beaten! I give it up. But do you
know, señor, that you have the honor to serve a
very remarkable young person?”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pardons, Señor Juez [Judge], I
have known that forever. <i>Si.</i>”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. There she comes; and I leave it to
you, Señor Vives, to convey to her family my
acknowledgment of her services. If in any way
I can serve her or them, they have but to command
me.”</p>

<p>The Judge had a better understanding of
human than equine nature. He knew that he
could not have found a messenger more delighted
to carry messages of courtesy than old Sutro, nor
one who would do so more gracefully. He knew,
also, that his cordial gratitude would be shorn of
nothing, but rather embellished, by its passage
over the caballero’s lips.</p>

<p>“At thy feet, señor. Thy appreciation of our
so beloved one will give pleasure to our household.
I have the honor to salute thee; and&mdash;Service?
Ten thousand pardons&mdash;but there is
a way in which&mdash;at thy leisure&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again the Judge pulled out his watch, “You
have but to name, as I said. To-morrow, during
the children’s study-hour, I will be pleased to
hear your suggestions.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Thanks. The service old Sutro
claims is for our ‘Little Lady of the Horse,’&mdash;not
for himself. <i>Mañana</i>, then; and <i>Adios</i>!”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Steenie, mounted upon her
Tito, and with her caballero walking proudly by
her side, paced slowly out of the Judge’s grounds.
“It has been a good, good day, my Sutro! Such
a happiness! You will be happy too, is it not?
And what do you think, besides? That kind,
splendid gentleman says that he has a pretty,
black horse, whom nobody uses much, that shall
be loaned to you whenever we wish for a long
ride. Then you will not have to go hobblety-bob
on those poor worn-out livery hacks. Are you
not glad?”</p>

<p>“Glad. <i>En verdad.</i> But of more yet, <i>mi niña</i>.
Old Sutro has something in his head besides nonsense,
no? Listen. He offered service&mdash;and
there is a way, in verity. I told him. <i>Mañana</i>&mdash;he
will do it, and Sutro’s heart will be at
peace. Thou wilt then have money&mdash;more
than thou canst ever use. It is so. I tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Su-tro-Vi-ves! What&mdash;have you done?
Have you asked that gentleman for money? Do
you need it? Why not ask my father, then?
Oh, Sutro!”</p>

<p>“<i>Tente</i> [hold on]! Thou leapest to a blunder
as Tito does over a hurdle. I have asked no
man for money, I. Why not? Because, in all
California, there is no man who has more of it
than I. And what I have I will give to thee.
Thou art to be my <i>heredera</i> [heiress], thou. After
Sutro Vives thou wilt inherit.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ha, ha, my rich one! And what shall
I inherit, sir? All your whims and notions, and
your old sombrero, maybe? ‘No?’”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Sta buen</i>’! Laugh if thou wilt; in derision
now, but, by-and-by, in glee. And what shalt
thou inherit? Wait and see. Wait and see. I
would have told thee but for thy ridicule. No
matter. Quite time enough for thee&mdash;when
Sutro Vives is done with life. Which will be
soon, no? But I say&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“And I say no, no, no! good Sutro,” said
Steenie, sobered instantly by the gloomy look
which settled upon her old comrade’s face. “You
are to live longer than any Vives who ever was,
and to use every bit of your wonderful riches for
your own cristy, crusty, blessed self. Hear me
say that, my caballero,&mdash;I, your own ‘Little Lady
of the Horse’! So there! And home again!”</p>

<p>Sutro smiled once more. His mood was wholly
dependent upon that of his beloved “<i>niña’s</i>,” who
was his one object in life; and, with the smile
still upon his face, he swung her from Tito’s back,
and led the latter away to the comfortable stall
which now bade fair to become his permanent
home.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Papa, Grandmother! And the
loveliest time in all the world! Oh, it’s just
fun, fun, fun to go to school in a summer-house&mdash;and
be a colt teacher afterward&mdash;Why,
Papa! What&mdash;what is the matter? Are your
eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p>But she did not finish the sentence. A groan,
such as is wrung from strong men only by great
trouble, fell from her father’s lips, as he stretched
out his arms to enfold her, and dropped his poor,
sightless eyes upon her shoulder. “My dear
little Steenie! What is to become of you!”</p>

<p>The child’s glance flew round to her grandmother’s
face; but its expression startled her
even more than her father’s despondency. Madam
Calthorp sat gazing straight before her, but seeing
nothing, saying nothing, while every drop of
blood seemed to have left her white cheek, and
the seams of an added decade to have fallen
upon it.</p>

<p>“Grandmother&mdash;don’t! Don’t look like that!
What awful thing has happened? Do speak to
me&mdash;please! Somebody!”</p>

<p>The words broke the spell of that strange
silence. But Steenie had never in her life seen
anything so sorrowful as the gaze which came
out of vacancy to fix itself upon her own person.</p>

<p>“My poor little darling, everything has come
upon us&mdash;but death. We are ruined. Ruined!”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>RESOLVED TUBBS.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Nobody said anything
more.</p>

<p>Steenie stood
perfectly still,
too perplexed to
even try to understand
what “ruin” meant;
till, after awhile,
her father lifted
his head and released
her from
this, to her
terrible, position.
Then she
darted from
the room and from those tragic faces, as if, by
turning her back upon them, she could banish
them from her thought.</p>

<p>In the kitchen she found Resolved Tubbs with
his Bible on his knee.</p>

<p>Now Resolved was a good man, a really sincere
Christian; but Steenie had lived long enough in
the house to learn that when Brother Tubbs sat
down at midday with his Bible on his knee and
his spectacles pulled into place, he was in a state
of mind to read Jeremiah only, and ignore the
more joyful prophets.</p>

<p>She had come with the gayest of spirits into
the astonishing gloom of the household, and she
wanted no more dismalness; so she tarried in
the kitchen but long enough to catch one sepulchral
gleam from Resolved’s uplifted “glasses,”
and passed out into the garden where she had
seen Mary Jane calmly gathering strawberries.</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be so awful, I believe, or she
wouldn’t be doing that!” thought the troubled
child, and hurried forward to the housekeeper’s
side.</p>

<p>“Mary Jane! dear Mary Jane! Whatever
has happened? What is ‘ruin,’ and who has
done it?”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. That’s a’most more’n I can say.
Didn’t they tell ye nothin’, dearie?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. Only Papa says: ‘What’s to
become of me!’ and Grandmother: ‘We’re
ruined.’ But I think Mr. Resolved knows, ’cause
he’s sitting down an’ looking unhappy reading.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“The miser’ble unbeliever!&mdash;even if he is my
own flesh an’ blood! Why can’t he turn to an’
do sunthin’, an’ keep a-thinkin’: ‘The Lord’ll
provide,’ stidder huntin’ out more trouble from
the blessed Book? I’ve a mind ter go in an’
shake him!”</p>

<p>“Why, Mary Jane! Shake Mr. Tubbs!”
Steenie’s horrified imagination picturing that
lumbago-tortured old man in his sister’s vigorous
grasp.</p>

<p>“Well, o’ course, not really. But, I’d like
ter know! Here comes the bad news, an’ down
flops the hull fambly, an’ goes ter sighin’&mdash;furnaces!
Stidder ary one liftin’ finger ter see
what kin be done ’bout it. That ain’t my way
o’ ’terpretin’ the Scripters; an’ I don’t want it
ter be your’n.”</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t be, Mary Jane. I don’t like
to feel bad, never.”</p>

<p>“No more do I! So&mdash;reckin you’ll be as well
off out here ’ith me, doin’ sunthin’, as anywheres
elset, fer the space o’ the next short time. So&mdash;jest
set down on the grass there, dearie, an’
hull what berries I’ve got picked, while I get
some more; an’ I’ll tell yer all I know ’bout
anything.”</p>

<p>Steenie promptly obeyed. Mary Jane’s cheerfulness
of temper was very pleasant, and they
had long ago become fast friends. “Now&mdash;tell,
please.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. Plain’s I understand it, it’s this
way: Your pa an’ yer granma has lost every
dollar they had in the world. They’re as poor
now as I be,&mdash;poorer.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Steenie, to whom “dollars”
and “poverty” conveyed no distinct impression.</p>

<p>“Well? Ain’t that enough? But I don’t
b’lieve you re’lize it a mite. I can’t, hardly
myself yet, nuther. But all the money yer
granma had, an’ it wa’n’t more’n jest enough
ter keep us livin’, plain an’ comfort’ble as we
do, was up in a bank, some’res. I hain’t no
faith in banks. They’re ’tarnally bu’stin’, er doin’
sunthin’ startlin’. I always keep mine in a
stockin’; an’ the stockin’ ’s in a big blue box
in the bottom o’ that hair trunk o’ mine. Things
bein’ so uncertain in this life, I think it’s best
ter tell ye; but don’t ye lisp a word,&mdash;not even
to brother Resolved. ’Cause he’d be boun’ ter
have it put in some differ’nt place not half so
safe. In case I should be took off suddent, as
folks sometimes is, somebody’d oughter know;
an’ you’re trustible. I’ve found that out.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. But, about the bank. What
is it?”</p>

<p>“Beat if I kin tell ye plain. ’Cause I don’t
scurce know myself. Old Knollsboro bank is
that big brick buildin’ acrost from the stun
church. An’ in it, somehow, folks hides all the
money they have; an’ the bank folks pays ’em
out little dribs on ’t to a time; an’ that’s all
they have ter keep house on. That’s as near as
I kin put it. Most every town has a bank, too;
but, ’cause yer pa thought they wasn’t no other
so safe as the old one here to Knollsboro he uset
ter put all his sellery, too, inter this one; an’
now it’s done jest like the rest on ’em often does,&mdash;it’s
bu’sted. That’s what Resolved calls it.
Yer granma said ‘failed;’ but I ’low it comes
ter the same thing when it means ’at every
dollar they had, uther one, is lost, somehow. An’
what’s wusser: yer granma owned ‘stawk’ in
it, too; though how anybody could keep a livin’
head er critter an’ not never let it be seen, ’s
more’n I fathom er try ter. I s’pose they partered
it out, er sunthin.’ An’ now that stawk’s
gone too, an’ ter make it good, she’s li’ble ter a
hull lot o’ thousan’ dollars. Think on it! Ever
so many hull&mdash;‘durin’&mdash;thousan’&mdash;dollars!
An she says&mdash;I heered her tellin’ Mr. Dan’l&mdash;that
‘she must pay it if it took this house.’
An’ he says: ‘Mother! Where you’ve lived yer
hull life! It would kill you!’&mdash;an’ I ’low it
would.”</p>

<p>“But how could a body pay anything with a
house?”</p>

<p>“Sell it, I s’pose, an’ take that money an’ throw
it arter t’other ’at’s gone. I dunno, rightly; fer
that’s jest what I asted Resolved, an’ all he said
was: ‘Sil-ly women! Sell er mortgage&mdash;sil-ly
wom-en! They don’t never have no heads fer
business!’ So, arter that, I knowed no more’n
I did afore,&mdash;which wasn’t nothin’, square. But
how’s a body to l’arn if their men critters won’t
l’arn ’em? An’ I guess we’ve got as many
berries as we shall eat ter-day; an’ that’s
knowledge more in my line ’n tryin’ ter explain
things I don’t understan’. So let’s go in out o’
the sun.”</p>

<p>They entered the house, whither Sutro had preceded
them, and found that sociable person vainly
endeavoring to extract more than monosyllables
from the lips of his house-mate, Tubbs. At
which Mary Jane’s ready wrath burst forth upon
her pessimistic brother.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what ails you&mdash;Resolved, ’at ye
can’t give a body a civil answer! You&mdash;hain’t
lost nothin’, ’at I knows on. An’ if ye call it a
Christian way o’ meetin’ trials, ter set there an’
let a poor heathen Mexicer pester the life out on
ye ’fore ye’ll speak him a decent word, I dunno!
It ain’t the way with good Baptist folks, anyhow.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Tubbs had long before accepted the
Methodist creed, while his sister had professed
another, this was an old bone of contention,
which he was quite ready to pick up, to the forgetfulness
of newer grievances.</p>

<p>Which was exactly what Mary Jane desired.
“Best way ter stir Resolved out o’ the hypoes is
ter make him mad! Then he’ll fly ’round an’
fergit lumbago an’ ever’thing elset. He’ll chop
more kindlin’ in ten minutes when he’s riled, ’an
he will in a hull day when things goes ter suit
him.”</p>

<p>He became “riled” on the instant, and shut his
Bible with a bang, while his spectacles were shoved
into their usual resting-place upon his bald head
with an energy that endangered the glass.</p>

<p>To escape an impending war of words, Steenie
retreated to the presence of her own kin once
more, and this time with a determination to beg
from them enough information to enable her to
understand clearly this new anxiety they were
suffering.</p>

<p>“Yes, Steenie, I will tell you,” said Madam
Calthorp, gently, and quite in her natural manner
again. “But do you go out of doors, Daniel.
The air is better for you, and Sutro has returned.
I will be careful in my disclosures, but there is no
need for you to hear the painful repetition.”</p>

<p>Mr. Calthorp rose wearily. There was a look
of hopelessness about his fine face which even
blindness had not brought to it; and Steenie
watched him depart with a heavier heart than
she had ever known.</p>

<p>“Now, Grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. To begin with, though we were
never rich, neither were we poor. We had
enough, with economy, to provide for all our
ordinary needs, and a surplus for emergencies.
What your father had inherited and acquired,
together with my own money, was all in one
place,&mdash;intrusted to a corporation of which your
grandfather was the founder, and which people
said was ‘as good as the bank of England.’
Some weeks ago, about the time you came from
Santa Felisa, I heard rumors of trouble about
this money of ours, and I instituted inquiries to
verify or disprove them. The report brought to
me was that they were without foundation,
that our possessions were as secure as they had
always seemed, and that I need have no uneasiness
whatever. I did not mention these rumors
to my son, because his own personal affliction
appeared to be as much as he&mdash;as any of us&mdash;could
bear; but now I wish that I had done so.
Of course he could not read; and his sensitiveness
about meeting people, together with my
mistaken kindness, kept him wholly ignorant
until the blow fell. This morning, after you
left us, a messenger was sent to us by the
directors, announcing the sudden and utter failure
of the bank; as well as that I, a stockholder,
am liable&mdash;that is, in debt&mdash;for several thousand
dollars. Now, this is exactly our situation:
I own this house and a small farm in another
part of the county. That I can sell for enough
to pay my indebtedness, except about one thousand
dollars. Many poor people will be losers
by this failure, and I cannot rest, retaining anything&mdash;even
if I might&mdash;which would relieve
their necessities. So, the only course left us is
to sell this house also; and out of its proceeds
pay the extra one thousand. There will be a
small sum remaining, or should be,&mdash;enough I
hope to hire a tiny cottage somewhere; but how
we are to exist in that cottage the future alone
can prove.”</p>

<p>Steenie listened attentively, breathlessly; her
big blue eyes fixed upon her grandmother’s face,
and rejoicing in the calmness which had returned
to it. She did not know that the only expression
of distress which the proud Madam had given,
had been the one exclamation at first sight of
her own self. “Everything has come upon us&mdash;but
death. We are ruined. Ruined!”</p>

<p>“When, Grandmother? When will we go to
the cottage?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know. Not just yet. The
adjustment of these matters will take time; we
shall not be disturbed in the immediate present;
but the eventual condition of affairs will be what
I have decided already. And Steenie, my dear
little child, now you have a chance to be even
doubly helpful to your poor father. Blindness is
a trial which no seeing person can comprehend;
but for a strong man to suffer it, and to know
that he cannot do one thing to alleviate the necessities
of those who are dear to him, is terrible.
It is this which is so intolerable to my son. If
he could regain his sight, no matter how poor he
was, he would face the world gayly for your
sake and mine. He would work for us and forget
all the mishap; but to be idle in such a
strait&mdash;ah! I know from my own heart what
it must be to him.”</p>

<p>“Poor, poor papa! But can’t <i>I</i> do something?
Maybe I can! I’m not blind nor old, and I’m
as strong as strong. See here! I can lift a
chair ever so high! And Judge Courtenay says
I’m most puffectly ’veloped for a ten-year-old
goin’ on ’leven. I’m much bigger’n Beatrice,
an’ she’s half-past twelve. Isn’t there some
way, Grandmother, dear Grandmother? Think,
please; in that in-telligence of yours, maybe
you’ll find out something. And if you do&mdash;won’t
I do it! Just you see!”</p>

<p>“You precious baby! If your ability only
matched your courage, Grandmother knows that
you would banish every care from all our hearts!
But, yes; there is one thing you can do: bear
whatever deprivations you may have with that
same sunny spirit; be patient when, by-and-by,
we older folks begin to lose our own serenity, and
grow fretful, perhaps, and difficult to get along
with. You can remember then that it isn’t
what you call our ‘truly selves,’ but the worn
nerves and depressed hearts that cause the sharp
words and moods. Early to learn a woman’s
lesson, my gay little Steenie; but I believe you
are capable of learning it well.”</p>

<p>All which Steenie did not quite understand.
This book-loving old student was apt to “talk
over the head” of a “’most-’leven”-year-old; but
she gained this much: that, no matter what happened,
she was to make things as bright as she
could, and her loving heart responded loyally.</p>

<p>“I’ll be as patient as patient. And I’ll never
let my papa think a thing I can help; and&mdash;Oh!
There’s the dinner-bell!”</p>

<p>Probably this common, every-day sound was a
relief to everybody in the house; and though the
meal was served a full hour later than usual, the
extra care which had been expended upon it more
than compensated for the delay.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Jane! How good that beefsteak
does smell!”</p>

<p>“Humph! Better enjoy it while ye kin. Only
the Lord knows how long any on us’ll eat beefsteak!”
commented Resolved Tubbs, dolefully.</p>

<p>“Hush yer complainin’, can’t ye! An’ as long
as the Lord continners ter bother ’ith us poor
worms an’ sends porter-houses, receive ’em in the
same sperrit, an’ be thankful!” retorted Mary
Jane.</p>

<p>“Well, I call that sacrilegious, if you have
enj’yed full immersion!” said the brother, snapping
at a fly upon the table-cloth with such energy
as to upset the salt.</p>

<p>“There it goes! Only the quer’l come afore
the upsettin’. An’ I do say it: I’d ruther be
sacrilegious with my tongue, ’an so sack-cloth-an’-ashesy
with my sperrit.”</p>

<p>“Resolved! Mary Jane!” remonstrated Madam,
sternly, yet with a smile dawning upon
her lips. And if ever a quarrel can be said to be
opportune, that one was; for Steenie laughed
outright, and Sutro tittered, while even Mr. Calthorp
lost the gravity of his expression for a little.</p>

<p>It was a good dinner! And there was more
sense in Mary Jane’s philosophy than in her
brother’s after all; for the savory dishes tempted
appetites into existence, and through material
enjoyment made even mental disquietude easier
to endure.</p>

<p>But after dinner was over, Mr. Calthorp retired
to his own room and closed the door, and Madam
retreated to her library; so that Steenie, driven
to her own resources, did the most natural thing
in the world: got Sutro to saddle Tito and set
off for a gallop, leaving the old caballero to attend
upon her father, “case he should come out
an’ want somebody an’ not both of us be gone.”</p>

<p>Sutro remained, partly on account of Steenie’s
argument, and partly that for a long ride he
utterly disdained the livery hack it had been his
fortune to use during his stay at Old Knollsboro;
for he did not feel quite free to go to Rookwood,
so soon again, and borrow “the pretty black
horse” which had been offered for his enjoyment.</p>

<p>Thus he was forced to hear various unpleasant
remarks from Resolved Tubbs’ grim lips about
“plenty o’ mouths ter fill ’ithout no furriners,”
and so on; all which, busied in visions of his
own brain, he ignored as referring to himself.
For wasn’t he at that very moment planning
the details of a scheme which should enrich
everybody?</p>

<p>As for Steenie, she gave Tito his head, and he
took it, far out into the open country, with a
will and spirit that drove every care from his
little rider’s mind. But after he had travelled a
long distance he cast a shoe; and, seeing a smithy
near, Steenie rode up to the door and coolly requested
to have the shoe set.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Steenie coolly requested to have the shoe set.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> 178.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Humph! Who are you, any way, child?
And who is going to pay me for my trouble?”
demanded the farrier, with equal coolness.</p>

<p>Pay for it? Why, at Santa Felisa, the smith
was “their own”&mdash;nobody paid. Here&mdash;Steenie
didn’t like such difficult questions, but
she answered, simply enough: “I s’pose somebody
will. I’m Steenie Calthorp; and Tito can’t
go home barefoot, over these rough roads, can
he? You must see that for yourself, Mr. Smith,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I see that, plain enough; and if you are one
of the Calthorps down at Knollsboro&mdash;here
goes! They’re honest folks, and always have
been. Never a poor man lost a cent by them,
and that’s the truth. They’re the right kind of
aristocrats, they are. Pay for what they have,
and what they can’t pay for go without, and no
complaining. But no matter this time aboot
pay for a trifle of kindness like this. I’ll
shoe this handsome fellow, and proud of the
job, any time you choose to ride out this way
and show me how a little girl <i>can</i> ride when
she puts her mind to it. That’s so. You may
count upon it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Smith! I’m sure that’s very kind
of you, an’ I ’preciate it. I like to see a man
shoe a horse, when he does it neatly, an’ what
Bob calls ‘with sense of a horse’s feelings.’ I
think I could almost be a farrier myself, sometimes.
I do, so.”</p>

<p>“A farrier, hey? There’s something you
could do far better than that. Where did you
learn to ride?”</p>

<p>“I never learned. I always rode.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At Santa Felisa, California.”</p>

<p>“So? Then all I have to say is that you had
better set up a school and teach some of these
young folks round here, who almost murder
their horses with their blundering clumsiness.
For I never saw anybody sit a horse as well as
you do; and that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>When the shoe was set, Steenie thanked the
helpful smith, promised to visit him again, and
went on her way homeward. But she was very
thoughtful and preoccupied; and Tito, fully
sympathizing with her mood, dropped into a
gentle canter, and broke his pleasant pace not
once till his mistress suddenly bent forward and
threw her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>“Tito, my Tito! I’ll do it! I will, I will!”</p>

<p>Tito softly nodded up and down. Whatever
she meant to do,&mdash;and it was something which
made her eyes shine and her face dimple with
hopeful smiles,&mdash;be sure that her wise playfellow
fully intended to help her.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Well, Señor
Vives, I am
at your service
now,” announced
Judge Courtenay,
at the next
appearance of Steenie
and her caballero at
Rookwood. “In what
can I advise you?”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. It is a profound
secret. Ten thousand pardons, Señor Juez
[Mr. Judge]; but I may close the door, no?”</p>

<p>“Close it, certainly, if you wish; but we
are not likely to be disturbed. This is my
private office.”</p>

<p>“I would not for a hundred worlds that others
should hear what I disclose!” repeated old
Sutro, cautiously.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly safe. Be assured.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si?</i> Then here is my desire: I wish to
prepare my <i>testamento</i> [will]. In verity, that is
my hope and prayer.” The Spaniard’s face wore
an expression of grave importance.</p>

<p>“Your will? Well, that is, indeed, a serious
matter. Have you fully considered it?”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> Have I not? <i>En verdad</i>, it has
long since been arranged&mdash;in here,” said the
client, tapping his forehead, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, let us to business. Give me
the points of the matter, and my clerk shall draw
up the paper.”</p>

<p>“Clerk? No, no! No. <i>Por Dios!</i> No.
Thinkest thou that I would give such knowledge
as I shall make known to the winds? It is
a secret, I tell thee. A secret!”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” answered the Judge, a
little impatiently. He was a very busy man,
just then enjoying a needed vacation, and he
had little inclination for clerical work, especially
in a case like this where the interests at
stake were, presumably, very small. He was
doing what he did for Steenie’s sake only;
because the old Californian was dear to the
child in whom he was so much interested.
“Very well, then; let us begin. What is the
first bequest?”</p>

<p>“The first? It is the last,&mdash;first, last, and
the whole. I wish to give everything I possess&mdash;that
is
Santa Trinidad&mdash;to the most adorable
Doña Steenie Calthorp.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? You are generous. What is Santa
Trinidad?”</p>

<p>“It is a mountain. It was part of Santa
Felisa Rancho, when San’ Felis’ was greater
than now, and belonged to the family of Vives,
yes.”</p>

<p>“It is valuable?”</p>

<p>For a moment the eye of the old man gleamed
craftily; then he asked: “Must thou know
that?”</p>

<p>“As you please.”</p>

<p>Sutro considered. By nature he was not very
secretive, and of lesser matters he was as sure
to babble as to breathe; but this was different.
He held, or believed that he held, knowledge of
utmost importance; and he had seen enough of
property dealings among the&mdash;to him&mdash;new
possessors of his old California to understand
that it was just the knowledge which would
make them defraud him if they could. Lord
Plunkett had seemed an honest man; yet it was
such as Lord Plunkett who had usurped the
broad acres once belonging to his own race and
people. However, he must trust somebody.
He must have help.</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> Wilt thou, Señor Juez, swear&mdash;<i>por
Dios</i>&mdash;that thou wilt not betray me? That
I can trust thee?”</p>

<p>“You can trust me entirely, but I will not
swear; for I give my oath to no man,” answered
the Judge, becoming interested.</p>

<p>For a full half-minute Sutro stared fixedly into
the face of his new friend; then, reading in that
noble countenance nothing but good-will and
uprightness, he plunged into his subject with a
recklessness which hid nothing, either of knowledge
or imagination. “La Trinidad is a cloven
mountain. Its inhabitants are rattlesnakes, who,
poor beasts, the Americans fear. Not so Spaniards
and men of sense&mdash;not even Indians; a
thousand times not so old Sutro. Why? Because
I understand, can meet them without peril;
and because <i>they are the guards to treasure untold</i>.
No man knows it save Sutro Vives&mdash;and now
thou; but the heart of La Trinidad is a heart of&mdash;”
The testator rose from his chair, his face
thrilled by excitement, and placing his lips to the
Judge’s ear, hissed one word therein.</p>

<p>“What is that you say?”</p>

<p>Sutro repeated the whisper.</p>

<p>“What! Man alive! Do you mean it? Do
you know this to be true?”</p>

<p>“As I know that the sun shines now. <i>En
verdad.</i>”</p>

<p>“What proof have you?”</p>

<p>“This.” Sutro unfastened his buckskin vest,
and opened a leathern bag which depended from
his swarthy neck. “Believest thou now?”</p>

<p>“I believe what I see, always. But that this
came from Santa Trinidad, how am I to know
that?”</p>

<p>“Humph! A caballero may lie, yes; but not
where he loves as I love Doña Steenie. Sawest
thou ever a child like her? Eyes of such clear
truthfulness? Lips so loving and so sweet?
Face so bonny? Ways so&mdash;not-to-be-resisted?
And heart so pure? No, a thousand times. She
is one&mdash;alone. She is under the especial charge
of Heaven. She is worth all&mdash;all. If the whole
of California were mine I would give it her, and
know it were well given. I would so, yes!”
And warmed by his own theme, the old man left
his chair and paced the room, gesturing eloquently,
as is the custom of his race.</p>

<p>Judge Courtenay’s interest increased; but, at
that moment, it centred less in the bequest than
in the beneficiary. “I agree with you, Señor
Vives, that there is something ‘not-to-be-resisted’
about this ‘Little Lady of the Horse,’ as you say
you Westerners call her; but still I cannot help
wondering how she has gained your devotion so
entirely.”</p>

<p>“How? Listen and thou shalt learn. When
the good <i>Dios</i> sent her into this world Sutro
Vives was a miserable old man,&mdash;even then.
He had been wronged&mdash;wronged&mdash;wronged&mdash;till
his heart was hard and bitter. He had lost
faith in everything, below and above; and he
kept Santa Trinidad in spite of everybody,&mdash;because
its serpent-infested rocks were a menace
to the world. From them he meant to take his
revenge. He used to carry them, the snakes,
down to the <i>hacienda</i>, and place them where
they would do the most harm. It was the only
joy left.”</p>

<p>“One day&mdash;the day they buried the poor
Señora Calthorp&mdash;he carried a creature bigger,
more venomous than any other. He turned it
loose on the threshold of Santa Felisa, and sat
down to watch. By-and-by, a little thing, all
soft and white, came creeping, creeping through
the doorway, and spied the serpent, yes. It was
pretty, too, and soft; but it was not white nor
good. The wicked Sutro watched. Santa Maria
watched also. The little fingers went out and
touched the reptile, and the Mother of God
touched a wicked heart. In a second&mdash;before
the beautiful head of the serpent could rear itself&mdash;<i>la
criaturita</i> [the baby girl] was in the old
man’s arms. Did she hate him, no? <i>Gracias
a Dios</i> [Thanks be to God]!&mdash;she folded her
own little arms about his neck and buried her
rose-leaf face against his ugly face; and the
demon of hate and murder left him. <i>Si!</i> That
is the tale.”</p>

<p>It was a moving one. Judge Courtenay was
not the man to resist its influence; nor did he
ever thereafter doubt one assertion of Sutro
Vives where Steenie was concerned. The love
that is rooted in superstition is love that lasts.</p>

<p>“Well, I will draw up the document for you
as carefully as possible. But the inheritor is a
minor. She must have some one appointed to
act for her until lawfully able to act for herself;
in case your demise occurs prior to that
time.”</p>

<p>This suggestion had a legal sound about it that
captivated Sutro’s ears; and he gathered enough
of its meaning to reply: “I understand. If I
die, it is the Señor Calthorp and Kentucky Bob
who will carry out my desires, no? But I do
not wish to die first. I wish to live, I myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes! We all wish that.”</p>

<p>“And must I die that my little one may get
the good of Santa Trinidad?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent your giving it to
her now, while you are still alive; but a ‘last
will and testament’ implies the death of the
testator before action is taken upon it.” Then
Judge Courtenay went on to explain, as simply
and briefly as he could, the various methods by
which Sutro Vives could benefit his favorite; and
the old Spaniard did the best he could to comprehend.</p>

<p>But gradually a belief came into Sutro’s mind,
and fixed itself there, that if he died she would
be better off. Because while he lived nobody
would care to spend the necessary money to
investigate the discovery he claimed,&mdash;mining
being a most expensive business; but if he were
dead, Steenie’s guardians or trustees might do so
for her benefit in justice to their ward.</p>

<p>Poor Sutro! It was a bitter notion, and one
that made his face grow pale as he contemplated
it. He didn’t want to die; he loved life dearly&mdash;dearly!
Even at this strange East, where it
rained whenever it felt like it, and not at stated
seasons when people were prepared for it and
duly expectant&mdash;as at San’ Felisa,&mdash;even here,
and with disagreeable Resolved Tubbs “to boot,”
existence had many pleasures,&mdash;not the least
among these being Mary Jane’s excellent cookery.
To die&mdash;to put himself forever out of the reach
not only of the Little Un, but of Mazan´ to whom
he had hoped to be reunited, and of delicious
chicken-patties, all at one fell swoop&mdash;that was
too much!</p>

<p>“Very well, then. I will delay the evil day,
no? They are not suffering now; and if this
thousand dollars is not paid yet&mdash;why, when it
falls due, there will still be time! <i>En verdad.</i> Is
it not so, Señor Juez?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, Caballero; but if
you have finished your directions I will put aside
these notes for the present. The will shall be
duly drawn up and read to you; when, if satisfactory,
it can be attested by your own chosen
witnesses. It is about time for me to take my
second lesson in colt training; and before I go,
I want to ask you if you have heard the Calthorp
family speak of this great bank failure, which
has ruined so many?”</p>

<p>“Have I not? <i>Si?</i> Is it not that which has
prompted, this day so soon, the <i>testamento</i>? That,
but for this sudden poverty, I could have postponed
till some far away <i>mañana</i> [future]. Señor
Tubbs says that my people have become poor&mdash;poor&mdash;poor.
My Señor Calthorp goes into his
room and broods and broods; and Señora, the
Madam, she smiles,&mdash;but with pale lips and
heavy eyes. Ah, it is cruel, cruel! I do not
understand. I am no&mdash;what shall I say? Here,
in my head, it is not clear to comprehend this
‘business’ of the Americans, I. It was that
‘business’ which was wrong when Santa Felisa
Rancho passed from my family to other men. It
is ‘business’ again,&mdash;a ‘bank,’ which is worst of
all,&mdash;and, lo! to-day our pockets burst with
the gold, to-morrow they hold not a coin. <i>Por
Dios!</i> It is all wrong&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Judge listened gravely. The flying rumors
he had heard were confirmed by Sutro’s statement.
He had known, all along, that his old
friends would be losers to some extent by this
failure; but the fact that it involved their all was
new to him and very painful. How to assist
them would be the question. The legal advice he
could give them would be theirs without the asking;
but if the reports were wholly true, they
would need something besides legal advice to put
the bread into their mouths.</p>

<p>“Papa! Are you never coming? We were
as good as we could be, yesterday; but we were
better to-day! And we were let off from study
five minutes before the eleven o’clock. Come,
please! Won’t you? I want to see you and
Diablo take your lesson, now Steenie and I have
done.”</p>

<p>Beatrice’s interruption was a pleasant relief to
the sombre thoughts of both lawyer and client;
and Diablo’s owner answered, promptly, “Oh!
oh! That is all, is it? Revenge? You wish to
see somebody else suffer the torture which the
last two hours have been to you? Eh? For
lessons and torture are synonyms in your book-hating
mind, I fancy, my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Now, Papa Courtenay! ’Xcuse me, but it’s
no such thing. You’re teasing me. And I
shouldn’t think it hard work just to play with
a colt!”</p>

<p>“Should you not? Unless I mistake my valiant
small girl, entirely, I think it would take a
deal of persuasion to make her exchange even her
dull lessons for mine!”</p>

<p>At which playful irony Beatrice pouted, then
laughed good-naturedly. She had now no ambition
horseward, beyond riding a very gentle old
pony at odd times; but she did enjoy the spectacle
of others doing that which she feared.</p>

<p>“And how about you, Miss Steenie? Are you
anxious to resume your ‘teaching’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! I am a’most hungry to see
Diablo! I told Papa ’bout him; an’ he said,
‘Then you’re happy, dearie!’ and I am. Horses
are so dear and lovely. They are so&mdash;so&mdash;what
is it when you love anything and it loves you
back?” asked Steenie, who had slipped her hand
into one of Judge Courtenay’s, while his own
little daughter held fast to the other.</p>

<p>“Responsive may be the word. But what is
Sir Tito being brought along for? Is he to be
introduced to Diablo?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. But that wasn’t the first, the truly
why. I&mdash;I have&mdash;there’s something I want
to ask you, by-and-by. That is, do you own
that big race-track over yonder, as Sutro
says?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I had it prepared for speeding my own
horses; but some of the neighbors use it also. I
am anxious to increase the interest, hereabouts,
in well-bred stock, and so we have trials on it
occasionally. By the way, there is to be a public
affair soon. The very best horses in the
county are entered for the contest,&mdash;prizes, and
so forth. I am quite anxious and doubtful over
the result; for, till now, my black filly Trix
has carried everything before her. But Doctor
Gerould, of South Knollsboro, has just bought
the famous Mordaunt, and I fear my lady Trix
will be hard pushed this time.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny, Steenie? My mama says
that Papa would rather win that race than the
biggest ‘case’ that ever was! She says live
horses are his hobby-horses, ’at he rides to
death! ’Cause she says ’at a’most every rich
man finds out some way to use money foolishly,
an’ Papa’s way is the goodest way there is,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Miss Beatrice! Retailing family
affairs for a stranger’s benefit?” asked the father,
pinching his little girl’s cheek, roguishly.</p>

<p>“Steenie an’ Sutro aren’t strangers, are they?
They’re just&mdash;us, I thought.”</p>

<p>“‘Just us’&mdash;quite right. But here we are!
Now, my fine fellow, look out for yourself!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go in first with this halter, please. Then
you can come when I call you,” said the small
mistress of ceremonies, and vaulted over the
paling, lightly and joyously.</p>

<p>There was no pretence about the sincerity of
her pleasure. Her sparkling eyes and dimpling
face declared that without words; and, to his
utter amazement, Judge Courtenay saw that the
pleasure was mutual, for, instead of showing
fear or resentment, or any trace of forgetfulness,
up marched Diablo, with all the eagerness in the
world, and extended his handsome nose with a
neigh of salutation.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well&mdash;well! Has the age of miracles
returned?” exclaimed the observer, almost
unable to believe his own eyes.</p>

<p>But when Diablo’s friendliness was forced to
extend to himself, and when, after an hour or
two of a “lesson” which the gray-haired pupil
enjoyed beyond expression, he was able to lead
the “unbreakable brute” quietly out of the
paddock to the “track,” his delight knew no
bounds.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, my little lady, I am your
debtor to a very great extent. I am ready to
give you anything you ask!”</p>

<p>“Huyler’s!” suggested Beatrice, in an eager
whisper. “Ask him for ‘Huyler’s’&mdash;do!”</p>

<p>“No conspiracy! What’s that you’re whispering,
missy?”</p>

<p>“Now, Papa! You said ‘anything,’ and I
thought&mdash;candy.”</p>

<p>“Is ‘Huyler’s’ candy? Pooh! I don’t care
for that. I want you to do something, though,
Beatrice. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Course. What?”</p>

<p>“Let me show you how to ride. On my own
Tito, that nobody ever rode but me, that could
be helped, that&mdash;Oh, you know!”</p>

<p>“Why? What for?”</p>

<p>“’Cause. Won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Will he run away?”</p>

<p>“He never did such a mean thing in all his
darling life! Swing her up, dear Sutro, please!”</p>

<p>Sutro lifted Beatrice, who uttered a little
squeal, half of terror, half of pleasure, and
placed her squarely on Steenie’s own comfortable
saddle. Then followed “lesson two,” while
the Judge continued his own experiments in
horse-training on another part of the course.
At the close of which, all came gayly together
at the entrance, and not a face showed any care,&mdash;not
even Sutro’s, who had now relegated to
that convenient “mañana” of his, the time
when he should “die.”</p>

<p>“Really, little Steenie, can I not serve you in
some practical way? I wish to do so most
heartily,” asked the master of Rookwood,
gratefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You can give me some advice. I
mean if you will,” answered she.</p>

<p>“Heigho! my practice is increasing!” thought
the legal magnate. Aloud he said: “To the best
of my ability.”</p>

<p>“I want to earn some money. I want to show
other little girls how to ride, same as I showed
Beatrice, here. An’ maybe to teach other folks
horses, too, like Diablo. ’Cause we’re ‘ruined,’
Grandmother says; an’ she’s an old lady, an’ my
father’s blind, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;Can I?”</p>

<p>“Wh-e-ew! You baby, you!”</p>

<p>A hurt, indignant flush rose into Steenie’s
eager face, and her lip trembled.</p>

<p>“There, there! My dear child! It was only
astonishment&mdash;admiration&mdash;which made me
say that! Don’t misunderstand me. You can
do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;which you set out to
do, you&mdash;you&mdash;brave little thing!”</p>

<p>With that the Judge wheeled sharply round,
and tears gathered in somebody’s eyes, but not
in Steenie’s.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">My dear, suppose
you let our friend
Sutro, here, ride
home and tell
your people that I am
going to keep you for
dinner? Then they
will not be anxious,
and we will have
leisure to consider this matter
thoroughly. What do
you say?” The Judge’s
tone, addressing Steenie,
was as grave and considerate as if she had been
Madam Calthorp herself, and it restored her
wounded pride at once.</p>

<p>Nobody likes being laughed at, least of all a
child, about whose earnestness there is never
any pretence. “Baby” had been a hard word
for ambitious ears to hear.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I should be as glad as glad to
stay! If&mdash;my grandmother said I was never
to ’trude upon your ‘family life;’ that just
’cause you asked me to study with Beatrice, I
mustn’t forget an’ be too&mdash;something or other.
It meant I mustn’t go round an’ be a ‘noosance,’
like Sutro is to Mr. Tubbs.”</p>

<p>“‘Noosance’! She couldn’t be a ‘noosance,’
could she, Papa Courtenay?” cried Beatrice,
dancing gayly about her friend, delighted with
the prospect of a visit.</p>

<p>“Never,” responded the Judge, cordially.
“Señor Vives, it is settled, then. Please convey
my regards to Madam Calthorp and her son, and
say to them that I will give myself the pleasure
of calling upon them toward nightfall, and will
bring this little girl with me. Your own affair&mdash;the
legal document&mdash;shall, also, be duly
arranged. Good day.”</p>

<p>“I have the happiness to salute thee, Señor
Juez. In verity, I am proud of the honor done
my little one. I will discharge thy message
immediately. Ten thousand thanks. <i>Adios.</i>”
With the lightness of youth the old Spaniard
sprung upon Tito’s back, doffed his sombrero,
bowed profoundly, and rode cheerfully away.</p>

<p>“How funny! It’s a side-saddle, too,” said
Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Yes. But that makes no difference to my
caballero. He can ride in any way on any
animal, and always well. My father says he
is a wonderful old man; but he doesn’t seem
any older ’n me, I think. He’s very good
an’ dear. My grandmother says ’at Sutro is
worth everything to my father now, in his
blindness.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, indeed! And now for
dinner. After that&mdash;for a talk about this
teaching business. A race to the house! Here
we go! And a box of that coveted ‘Huyler’s’
to the winner! Step&mdash;step&mdash;step! One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
Off!” Away flashed the gay
frocks, up and down flew the little black-stockinged
legs, and long before the Judge had
covered half the distance, the children sat cuddled
together on the piazza-step, hugging each other
in the exuberance of their love and happiness.
“It’s so puffectly nice to have a little girl,
same’s me!” cried Steenie, ecstatically. “I
used to have the ‘boys’ an’ nobody else. I
didn’t know ’bout girls, then, an’ the ‘boys’
are dear as dear! But I like girls, now I’ve
seen ’em,&mdash;some girls.”</p>

<p>“Me? Do you like me?”</p>

<p>“Course I do. Wasn’t I just telling you?
Say, would you like to ride in a circus?”</p>

<p>“My&mdash;sake! No! Would you?”</p>

<p>“Course. I have,&mdash;lots of times.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;Steenie&mdash;Calthorp! Where? When?
How? Who let you?”</p>

<p>“Out home. Santa Felisa. Ever so many
whens. Last one, just before we came away;
to show the Plunketty man&mdash;Lord&mdash;what his
own ranchmen could do. My father let me.
Course.”</p>

<p>“Was he nice?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The Plunketty man-lord. What is a man-lord,
any way?”</p>

<p>“Think I didn’t say it right. I mean lord-man.
That is an Englishman. My father says
he can’t find land enough in their little bit o’
island to buy, so he came to California an’ bought
San’ Felisa. But he didn’t come again for
twelve years, a’most. An’ I never saw him, an’
then I did; an’ he didn’t wear a cor’net at all!
And he laughed like anything when I told him
what Suzan´ said. An’ he ’xplained beautiful.
He does have the cor’net, but he doesn’t have it
for himself. It’s his houses’. An’ sometimes
the women of ‘his house’ wear it, when they
‘want to make a stunnin’ show of theirselfs.’
But mostly they ‘have more sense,’ an’ leave it
where it b’longs, ’mongst the family plates an’
‘gew-gaws.’ That’s what he told me.”</p>

<p>“Gew-gaws? Ginger! Was he a really,
truly, lively lord? Was he?”</p>

<p>“Live as anything. Live as you. Live as me
or your papa. But, Beatrice, you shouldn’t say
‘ginger.’ My grandmother says it’s not c’rect
to use ’spressions.”</p>

<p>“But there <i>is</i>&mdash;ginger! The cook puts it in
molasses-cake. So there!”</p>

<p>“Well. It’s c’rect enough to eat, I s’pose.
But little gentlewomen should show they’s little
gentlewomen by their languages. So my grandmother
says, an’ she knows. ’Cause she knows
everything in this whole world.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t! She isn’t big enough. My
papa says nobody knows everything. An’ he
talks mostest ’bout grammar, not gentlewomens.
He wouldn’t let you say ‘hisself’ or ‘theirselfs,’&mdash;I
mean if he could help it. ’Cause he wouldn’t
me. An’ I know better ’n you, you see, ’cause
I’ve been teached longer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose you do. Though my grandmother’s
c’rected me lots o’ times ’bout them
very same words. I&mdash;Only I forget. My
forgettery is always easier ’n my memory. Isn’t
yours? An’ anyhow I don’t know anything,
’cept ’bout horses. But I know more ’bout them
’an I could tell you ‘in a month o’ Sundays.’”</p>

<p>“How long is a ‘month o’ Sundays?’ When
does it come? Before Christmas?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Mary Jane knows. She
talks ’bout it. An’ it comes&mdash;why it must
come any time! ’Cause when Mr. Resolved
goes to market she tells him not to be a ‘month
o’ Sundays,’ or she can’t get the dinner cooked
in time. And&mdash;lots&mdash;Here’s your papa! Oh,
I tell you I love him! He’s so dear.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t! He isn’t yours. You can’t
have him,” cried Beatrice, feeling her young
heart swell with jealousy.</p>

<p>“But I can love him, can’t I? If you couldn’t
love my father you would be funny. And, oh,
isn’t it happy to be so glad! Most always, anyhow,
I think this is an awful nice world. Folks
are so cosey an’ kind.”</p>

<p>“An’ I don’t think it’s nice one bit. You’ll
get the candy; I know you will. You got here
first!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;if I did? Wouldn’t I give you half,&mdash;the
evenest half we could measure? S’pose I’d
want it if you didn’t have it too? Say, s’pose
they’ll be dinner enough?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Course they will.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad. But you see they didn’t
know I was coming; an’ Mary Jane says I’m
the ‘beatenest eater for a little girl she ever
saw;’ an’ sometimes when comp’ny comes to
my grandmother’s she scolds, Mary Jane does.
’Cause she says: ‘I have enough cooked for my
own folks, but not enough for my neighbors,’ an’
it makes her angry. An’ my grandmother says,
solemn-like: ‘Ma-ry-Ja-ne!’ an’ then Mary Jane
goes in the kitchen an’ bangs things around; an’
Mr. Tubbs laughs, an’ she gets madder, an’&mdash;I
shouldn’t like to make your cook feel that
way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid! You can have all you
want to eat; an’ if they isn’t enough you can
have mine, too. I ain’t ever hungry.”</p>

<p>“My! Thank you. You’re a lovely, nice
girl. But I wouldn’t eat it. Why aren’t you
hungry? There’s the bell!”</p>

<p>Away they ran dinner-wards, and found the
Judge rehearsing to his wife the incidents of the
morning, and evidently something of Steenie’s
ambition; for the lady bestowed upon the child
a caress more cordial even than usual, and called
her a “dear, brave, helpful little thing.”</p>

<p>There proved to be not only enough of food
but to spare; and when the meal was over Judge
Courtenay retired to his office with his secretary,
while the children went into the parlor, where
Steenie was asked to tell her hostess all about
her desired “riding-school,” and what had suggested
it to her.</p>

<p>“It was the blacksmith made me think about
it, when he shod Tito. He said I ‘ought to;’ an’
I s’pose maybe he knows ’bout my father being
blind, an’ my grandmother an old lady that never
did anything but read books, an’ they both being
so ‘helpless,’ Mr. Tubbs says. But he, Mr.
Resolved, thought I was ‘helpless,’ too; only I
don’t want to be. ’Cause I’m not old nor blind,
an’ I’m strong as anything. But I don’t know
very much, ’cept ’bout horses; an’ I do know
’bout them, way through. So&mdash;well, you see&mdash;after
the blacksmith talk&mdash;I thought an’
thought&mdash;an’ thought. First off, it made me
dizzy&mdash;just the thinking. Then I wasn’t dizzy
any more for being sorry&mdash;but just for glad!
An’ I hurried home fast as fast; an’ there was
my father taking a nap, ’cause he doesn’t sleep
good nights; an’ after supper some comp’ny
came, an’ they stayed till I went away to bed.
Then this morning there they were again; an’
they were a man an’ his clerk, or something, an’
my grandmother an’ my father went into the
library an’ shut the door, so I didn’t have any
chance to ask him. Then when I was coming
here, I thought maybe I was glad I hadn’t.
’Cause my grandmother says your Mr. Judge is
a terr’ble wise gentleman; an’ I know so too.
An’ I thought prob’ly he knew all the little girls
an’ colts in Old Knollsboro; an’ maybe they’d
like to learn to ride the right way. And the
blacksmith said I’d ‘make a fortune’ showing
’em. I’d like to make it, or some money, I
mean. Any way if I could do one thing to buy
beefsteaks with, I ought to, hadn’t I? ’Cause
Mr. Tubbs says, ‘The Lord only knows how long
any on us’ll eat beefsteak,’&mdash;an’ we all like it.
Even my grandmother does. It would be awful,
wouldn’t it, for an old lady like her to not have
any more?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, it would be very bad indeed;
but I hope matters are not quite so serious as
that,” answered Mrs. Courtenay, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, course. But Mary Jane
says we’d all ‘better be lookin’ out to earn an
honest penny, those on us ’at can.’ An’ Mr.,
her brother, said she ‘needn’t cast no ’flections
on him, ’cause hadn’t he got the lumbago, he’d
like to know?’ So, you see, it’s just this one
straight way: Grandmother can’t, ’cause she
can’t, an’ she oughtn’t to; Papa can’t, ’cause he
can’t see to do anything; Sutro can’t, ’cause he’s
just Sutro; Mr. Tubbs can’t, ’cause he’s a lumbagorer
an’ a ‘reg’lar funeral-dark-sider,’ Mary
Jane says; Mary Jane can’t, ’cause her ‘hands
an’ heart is full every ’durin’ minute, an’ so she
tells you;’ an’ so, after them, they isn’t anybody
left but me. So I want to; ’cause I love ’em&mdash;love
’em&mdash;love ’em&mdash;every one! An’ I’m
young, an’ I can see, an’ I haven’t any lumbago,
an’ I’m not just Sutro, an’ my hands an’ heart
isn’t full, and&mdash;do&mdash;you s’pose I can?”</p>

<p>“My dear little girl, I have perfect faith that
you can!&mdash;providing that your people will consent,”
answered Mrs. Courtenay, with the most
confident of smiles, and very shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they consent? Wouldn’t
they be the most gladdest they could be? ’Cause
I’d give them the money, an’ they could buy the
things.”</p>

<p>“Who told you about ‘money,’ and money-earning,
Steenie?” asked the lady, somewhat
curiously, wondering how a child brought up “in
the wilderness” had learned its value.</p>

<p>“Why, Sutro. I asked him what it meant to
be ‘ruined,’ an’ he told me. He’s ruined, himself,
he says; anyhow he’s lost his home, same
as Grandmother’ll have to lose hers; an’ he says
that he had to go to work an’ earn money, an’
that was why he didn’t ‘starve to death, <i>en
verdad</i>!’ I should think it would be dreadful
to starve to death, shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly should.”</p>

<p>“You see Sutro&mdash;I don’t know ’xactly how it
was. But when I was as little as little, my father
told Sutro ’at if he’d tend to me an’ not let anything
bad ever happen to me, he’d pay Sutro
money. Wages, it’s called. So they did it; an’
Sutro was my body-servant forever after that.
Papa paid him every month, ’cause it wasn’t the
Plunkett man’s money at all. An’ Sutro has
saved it. An’ I don’t know. He showed me
most of it ’at he hadn’t spended; an’ it does
seem funny that folks’ll give you food an’
clothes an’ things just for it; but he says yes.
An’ if I earn, an’ he helps me, don’t you see?
Oh, I hope they will let me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;hardly know. I wish you to be happy
with all my heart; and so I mean that you shall
succeed&mdash;if they are willing. But they are a
proud family,&mdash;the very leading family of Old
Knollsboro; and they may feel it&mdash;well, not
just the thing for the little daughter of the
house to teach even a ‘riding-school.’ But
we’ll see. By the way, where would you like to
hold your school? Tell me all that you have
thought about it, please.”</p>

<p>“Why, on your race-course. Why not?” asked
Steenie, brightly and innocently.</p>

<p>“Why, Steenie Calthorp! My papa’s race-track
is my papa’s! He won’t let anybody,
’cept them he invites, go on it, not once at all.
He says it’s private, for his own ’musement, an’
if folks want tracks let ’em have their own. He
wouldn’t let other little girls, ’cept you an’ me,
ride their ponies there, ever; would he, Mama?”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer for another, even your
father, my dear. But I think that some fitting
place could be found,” replied the mother, quietly.</p>

<p>Steenie looked up quickly. Her big blue eyes
were filled with astonishment, and a pink flush
stole deeper and deeper into her pretty face. Her
native instinct, the instinct of a gentlewoman,
told her that she had blundered in some way,
yet she could not see how. If Judge Courtenay
was her friend,&mdash;why, he was!&mdash;and that was
the end of it. Why should he draw the line
anywhere?</p>

<p>“Please, Mrs. Courtenay, was I ’truding then?
Grandmother said I was never to do that. She
said I had lived in a beau-tiful big, big place like
Santa Felisa, an’ I was used to being mistress of
everything; but I was to ’member that here, in
this little bit o’ Old Knollsboro, I was only a
little bit o’ girl. But if the dear Judge doesn’t
want me to use his course, why I can find a
place, somewhere, big enough. I guess maybe
the blacksmith can tell me. He was a very
nice man, too.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay watched the troubled little face
grow bright and sunny again, and then she sent
the children out to play; after which an elegant
carriage was brought round, and a groom in livery
assisted the lady into it, and lifted Beatrice to a
place beside her. But Steenie needed no assistance,
and was quite contented when the Judge
took the empty seat next her, and she heard
the order given, “To Madam Calthorp’s, High
Street.”</p>

<p>It was a gay and happy party, and they carried
their own good cheer with them into the care-shadowed
home which they entered,&mdash;the greetings
of the elders being even more cordial and
sympathetic than ever, could that have seemed
possible.</p>

<p>Nothing, not even heart-break, could make
Madam Calthorp other than the noble, gracious
woman she had always been; and no sign of the
burden she was bearing was permitted to inflict
itself upon her guests. Yet even her self-reliant
spirit gained fresh courage from the support of
these friends whom she held in such high esteem;
and she was delicately forced to remember that
the Judge would be honored if she would make
use of him in any way.</p>

<p>“Yes, Steenie, show Beatrice anything. And
you will find some roses in the garden, the sort
her mother likes. Thank you; but, Judge, such
things are usually very simple. I have had one
of the bank men here over night. There is
nothing left, absolutely, beyond my trifling
amount of real estate. I shall put this house
on the market, and dispose of it as speedily as
possible. I have already written to accept an
offer which I had for the little farm; and&mdash;that
is all. If you hear of a small cottage anywhere
in town, that is not in an objectionable
neighborhood, will you kindly let me know?
And now&mdash;let us talk about your horses. I’m
sure that Daniel will enjoy a description of them.
He is quite a horse-lover, though not like Steenie&mdash;all
horse! Did you ever know a taste so
marked? It amounts almost to a passion with
her; due to her training at Santa Felisa, I suppose.
Well, it has made her a perfectly healthy
and wonderfully happy child. I am grateful to
the odd rearing for that much, at least.”</p>

<p>“And for much more!&mdash;that is, you may be!”
returned the Judge, impulsively. His heart was
still glowing warmly with thoughts of Steenie’s
brave desire, and the words escaped him almost
unconsciously.</p>

<p>“Indeed! How so? I fear that even her
last intercourse with the equine race is about
over for poor little Steenie.”</p>

<p>“It should not be. No, no; it must not be!&mdash;that
would be a crime. Let me tell you,
please,” and the gentleman described, far more
minutely and eloquently than the little girl had
done, her marvellous influence over Diablo, and
her instruction of himself. He concluded enthusiastically:
“It is her gift&mdash;Heaven-sent!
She is the best friend the horse ever had, I
believe. And that child’s beneficent influence
is destined to work a complete revolution, hereabouts,
in the future treatment of the noble
animals. It is as if she had a magical power of
entering into their very feelings, inclinations,
joys, and sufferings. I never witnessed anything
like it! Yet the only explanation she can give
is: ‘It isn’t anything I do. I don’t know how
to explain it&mdash;only I just love them so!’ My
dear Madam, your grandchild is a phenomenon.
Better than that&mdash;she is the bravest, noblest
little creature who ever lived.”</p>

<p>“Judge, Judge! You are too enthusiastic,
and too kind!” answered Steenie’s amazed grandmother.</p>

<p>“Enthusiastic, perhaps; but I could not be too
kind to a child like that. It is an honor to serve
her. She has taught me, not only what a fool
I have been about horses, but how to meet
trouble, disaster. Listen to this: here is her
idea&mdash;that baby’s!”</p>

<p>Launched upon his subject, Judge Courtenay
poured out the whole story. Steenie’s half-formed
plans had taken full shape and detail
under the consideration of his own maturer
mind, and not only this, but he had actually decided,
mentally, upon the children to be selected
for her first pupils. He could not see one good
reason why the project was not wholly feasible,
with Sutro and himself to “back” it with age
and experience.</p>

<p>“She shall have the course at Rookwood for
ordinary weather; and I will have a great building
erected for stormy days. I know several
persons who have valuable colts, and they will
gladly avail themselves of her gentle method of
‘breaking in.’ They shall pay her well, too!
The school terms we will regulate by those of
city riding-schools; and she shall have the use of
as many of my horses as is necessary, besides
her own Tito. That old Sutro is just the fellow
to assist; and my grooms shall do the rough
work.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Judge, but it appears to me as if
this were to be your school,&mdash;not my little
daughter’s!” exclaimed Mr. Calthorp, smilingly.</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;all right! Make it so, then!
Let it be my institution, and she my salaried instructor.
Why not? That is an improvement
upon the original plan,&mdash;decidedly an improvement.
People will be less inclined to shirk their
tuition fees to me, a grim old lawyer, maybe,
than to her. Yet I think she would never lose
a penny. How could she,&mdash;if men and women
are human?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay had been observing their hostess,
and interrupted, gently: “My dear, you are
taking for granted the consent of Steenie’s guardians.
However, I trust it will not be wanting.”
The speaker noticed, regretfully, that the children
had returned, and that the little subject of
the discussion was standing on the threshold of
the room, her lithe young body eagerly poised
and her eyes intently watching her grandmother’s
face for the answer forthcoming, which was
made speedily and courteously, but it struck
upon Steenie’s heart with intolerable cruelty.</p>

<p>“Thank you, cordially, my dear friend. Your
generous kindness is fully appreciated&mdash;fully.
But I have already reached a more practical decision,&mdash;one
which will put more money, even,
into Steenie’s pocket than this chimerical, if unselfish
scheme of hers could ever do. We will
sell Tito. Do you know of a purchaser?”</p>

<p>In the silence which followed this unexpected
suggestion, Steenie heard her own heart beat.
Then she bounded into the centre of the room,
white with fear and indignation.</p>

<p>“Grandmother! Sell&mdash;my&mdash;Tito!”</p>

<p>“Yes, darling. We can no longer afford to
keep him.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t! You mustn’t! It would
break his very heart! I’d rather you’d sell
me!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">For a time nobody
said anything
more. Then
Madam Calthorp
resumed, but in
a very kindly and sympathetic
tone: “Yes, my
darling, we can no longer indulge
in any luxury.”</p>

<p>Steenie found courage to
speak again. “I don’t know
what that is. But Tito isn’t
a ‘luxury,’ is he? He’s just
a dear, darling little horse!”</p>

<p>“Which, under our changed circumstances,
means that he is a luxury, as well.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t! You shall not! You dare
not! He’s mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine!”</p>

<p>“Steenie!” said the father, in a pained voice,
and opening his lips for the first time.</p>

<p>The child flew to him in a passion of tears.
“She can’t&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;He’s folks! He
can’t be sold. It would&mdash;break&mdash;his very&mdash;heart!”</p>

<p>Touched by the distress of her little friend,
Beatrice grew angry and resentful also, and
darted to her own father, who put his arm about
her and kissed her, glad of anything upon which
to vent his emotion; for it must be owned that
the big, wise man was almost as vexed and uncomfortable
as the two children were.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay walked over to the bay-window
and examined an album of etchings, trying, but
failing, to appear at ease. To all present it was
a very unpleasant scene.</p>

<p>Yet there was no disputing the plain common-sense
of Madam Calthorp’s decision, who, it is
also true, had no real conception of the strength
of the bond between the child and her beloved
four-footed friend, her only playmate during all
her little life.</p>

<p>Steenie had parted from Tito at Santa Felisa,
bravely and cheerfully as she could, “for Papa’s
sake;” but she had believed it to be a parting
for a time, merely. She had then full faith in
the cure of her father’s blindness, which was to
be effected by some unknown physician in an
equally unknown “East;” and she had looked
forward to a joyful return and reunion, when
everything and everybody was to be even happier
than before.</p>

<p>Now she knew better what “trouble” meant;
and to part with Tito forever seemed like cutting
her own heart in two.</p>

<p>“Steenie, my granddaughter! Do not forget
that there are others present to whom an exhibition
of domestic misunderstanding must be most
disagreeable. You may take the basket of sea-shells
into the dining-room, if you like, and show
them to Beatrice.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about sea-shells, ma’am,” responded
Beatrice, with what she considered
great politeness.</p>

<p>“An’&mdash;an’&mdash;please ’xcuse me!” said Steenie,
tremulously, and ran out of the house, stableward,
faster than even her fleet feet had ever
sped before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay rose, “I think, Judge, that
it is really time we should go. I have another
call to make, and it is growing late. I
hope, dear madam, that you are satisfied with
Steenie’s progress under Miss Allen. She tells
me that the little thing is very bright at her
studies.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; fully satisfied. Yes, I think, I
am sure that our little girl has intelligence; only
her instruction has heretofore been so deficient,&mdash;in
every way. I trust you will pardon her rudeness,
and expect better things of her by-and-by.
She has been a trifle spoiled, I fear. However,
I believe that she will make rapid advancement
after she is once well started. And
pray do not think, Judge, that because I found
your ‘riding-school’ too big a venture for a
child not yet eleven to undertake, that I do
not estimate your own unselfish motive most
highly. It simply&mdash;could not be.” Madam
Calthorp’s smile as she said this was very bright
and very proud.</p>

<p>“That’s it! It’s the miserable Calthorp pride
that is at the bottom of it!” muttered the Judge,
as he rode away. “The father had more sense;
he saw no objection to our idea any more than I
do, or any other sensible person could. It is
an original scheme, of course; but where would
the world be if it were not for original people
now and then? The child has a talent&mdash;a genius&mdash;in
a unique line. Well, then, why not develop
it,&mdash;same as music, art, or any other great gift?
And she’d be perfectly safe,&mdash;I’d see to that;
they must have known it.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless they did; and I know something
else.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”&mdash;a trifle shortly. It does
not improve the temper of most people to
have their generosity declined, and the Judge
was no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>“That you will buy Tito, if he must be sold,
and keep him at Rookwood for his own little
mistress.”</p>

<p>“Or for me, Mama, maybe.”</p>

<p>“No, dear Beatrice, for Steenie. Surely you
do not wish to take her beloved horse away from
her?”</p>

<p>“No, course I don’t; but, you see, I thought
maybe that old Madam lady would say she
couldn’t have him. ’Cause she ’peared to me’s
if she liked to be kind of mis’able an’ give up
things. Same’s I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Beatrice!”</p>

<p>“The child is right. Madam Calthorp is a
fine woman, but she is as proud as Lucifer. He
had to tumble, and she will, or I’m mightily
mistaken. It takes a very noble nature to accept
favors graciously; and she had an idea that
I was conferring, or trying to confer, a favor,
which I was not at all. I think it would be the
best thing ever happened in this locality, and to
the dumb beasts in it, if that blessed, loving
little thing could have a chance to preach to us
in her innocent way. I mean she shall yet, too!
And I suppose that to have a little girl earn anything
towards the family support was a bitter
motion, also.”</p>

<p>“The most bitter, I think, husband. However,
we can do nothing more. But we must
have Steenie at Rookwood as much as possible.
If one is bound to be kind and helpful one can
generally find a way, though not always the way
first chosen. Remember that, Beatrice, and be
watchful for Steenie’s happiness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mama, I think somebody ought to watch
it; ’cause herself’s bein’ comf’table is the last
thing she cares about.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, my darling,” said the mother,
fondly, as she alighted to pay her second call,
and thinking very tenderly of the other little girl
who had never known the sweetness of a mother’s
commendation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the house in High Street, a few
earnest words had been said by blind Daniel Calthorp,
which touched, if they did not convince,
the proud heart of its mistress.</p>

<p>“The scheme is not as wild as it seems, dear
mother. If you could see my darling among her
friends, the horses, you would understand.”</p>

<p>“But to have it said that a child&mdash;a little
girl-child&mdash;is our maintenance! Daniel, is it not
absurd? Besides, could she actually earn enough
to amount to anything?”</p>

<p>“I think so. However, we will not discuss
further to-night,&mdash;perhaps not at all. Only, if
you think it would be difficult for you to accept
aid from the hand of a child, what do you
think it is for me&mdash;a man? My blindness was
not of my own choosing; and Steenie’s talent has
not been given to her for nothing. Do you remember
what my father used to say? ‘God never
shuts one door but He opens another.’ The doors
seem to be pretty fast closed on every side our
lives, just now, Mother. Was this&mdash;one of His
opening? Let us find out that; and&mdash;I’ll go
to Steenie now.”</p>

<p>“You need not. She comes here to you,”
and, despite her decision, which had made her
seem so “hard” and stern to her little granddaughter,
it was a very proud and loving glance
which rested upon the now dejected face of the
household darling. “Come here, my little one.
I have something to say to you.”</p>

<p>Steenie obeyed; but she did not raise her eyes
from the floor, and her small hands were clinched
tight together,&mdash;in a habit she had adopted to
help “keep the tears back.” She expected a reprimand
for her rudeness, and she anticipated it. “I
came back&mdash;’cause&mdash;my father says&mdash;no matter&mdash;I
mustn’t never&mdash;be anything but nice&mdash;as
nice&mdash;to you. I didn’t mean you&mdash;Grandmother;
not you&mdash;yourself. I&mdash;I only&mdash;Tito&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Steenie. I understand you fully.
I have quite forgiven anything that there is to
forgive. I should have broken the sad news to
you more gently if I could, but you happened
to overhear it. What I want to tell you, now,
dear, is that I think you are the bravest, dearest
child I ever knew. It was a very kind desire of
yours to help us in the only way which was natural
to your peculiar life and training; but what
would do in the far West would hardly answer
here in Old Knollsboro. However, you still have
an opportunity to be brave and kind. I have decided&mdash;I
trust that your father agrees with me&mdash;that
the first sacrifice demanded of you is&mdash;Tito.
It is painful to me to ask it; but it is
right. I hope you will meet this trial in the
same spirit which you displayed in this other impracticable
scheme. May I depend upon you, my
darling?”</p>

<p>A sob that shook her whole sturdy little body
welled up and broke from Steenie’s lips; and
though the great tears now rolled over the round
cheeks her blue eyes were raised steadfastly and
her dainty mouth forced itself into a smile, so
brave and determined, yet so pitiful, that it
pierced Madam Calthorp’s heart like a knife.</p>

<p>With an impulse foreign to her self-controlled
nature she caught her grandchild to her heart,
and bent her white head upon the brown curls,
while a sympathetic sob escaped her own lips.
This was the first actual taste of the poverty
which had befallen her household, and she found
it bitter indeed.</p>

<p>But from that moment, strange as it seemed to
Steenie’s own self, she loved her grandmother as
she had not done before, and felt so sorry for
her that personal grief was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Madam, lifting her head,&mdash;“now,
what is to be done, I want done quickly; to me
waiting and suspense are intolerable. We know
that we must leave this house; let us leave it
as soon as possible. To-morrow I will advertise
it for sale, and hope for a speedy purchaser.
Fortunately, High-Street property is rarely offered,
and there is always a greater demand than
supply. Hark! Is that the supper-bell?”</p>

<p>“Yes,’m. Come. Papa, dear, I’m hungry, anyhow.
And I gave Tito heaps and heaps. But I
think you’ll have to speak to Sutro. He didn’t&mdash;he
didn’t behave very nice. But he&mdash;felt&mdash;pretty
mis’able, an’&mdash;Why, Mr. Tubbs!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tubbs, indeed! Never within Madam Calthorp’s
memory had that worthy “professor”
entered her presence in such a condition as this.
His hair looked as if it had never been combed;
his spectacles were broken and dangling from his
neck, instead of reposing respectably upon his
bald forehead; his coat was torn and covered
with bits of hay; and&mdash;must the truth be
owned?&mdash;one pale gray eye was bruised and
half-hidden by the rapidly swelling flesh which
surrounded it; worst indignity of all, he was
being marched into the dining-room by Mary
Jane’s forcible grip upon his shoulder, and it was
her disgusted voice which called attention to his
damaged condition.</p>

<p>“Yis! I should say so! ‘Mis-ter Tubbs!’
Here he is! A wolf in sheep’s clothin’! Him a
Methodist an’ a class-leader! Look at him!
Drink him in! He ain’t nobody but my brother&mdash;oh,
oh, oh!”</p>

<p>“Resolved! Mary Jane! Explain this matter
at once. What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Happened, ma’am? Nothin’ but a&mdash;fight!
A reg’lar, school-bubby actin’ up! It’s them two
old simpletons, Sutro an’ Resolved. They’ve
always wrangled an’ jangled ever sence they fust
sot eyes on one another. But I’ve managed ter
keep ’em from fisticuffin’ up till now. An’ him
my only brother! A shinin’ light in the church,
he is! Wait till I get my dishes washed, an’
I’ll step down ter Presidin’ Elder Boutwell’s, an’
let him hear what kind o’ sperritooal goin’s on
we have down this way!”</p>

<p>“But why should you and Sutro Vives quarrel,
Resolved? What provocation did he give you?”
asked Mr. Calthorp, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ in the world! It’s my poor, sinful
old brother here, that’s done all the prov-ockin’!
A tellin’ that poor heathen old Catholic that they
wasn’t no use fer him here, no more. An’ no
bread ter fill the mouths o’ our own household,
let alone Mexicers. When he knowed well
enough ’t I’d jest done my reg’lar bakin’, an’
no beautifuller never come out o’ that oven
this hull summer, let alone more. An’ then
pilin’ it on top o’ that, how if it hadn’t a be’n
fer him&mdash;Sutry&mdash;’at Steenie needn’t ’a’ gin up
her pony! Don’t wonder old feller was mad;
an’ fust he knowed Resolved got a snap-word
back&mdash;an’ then! Well, you know, ma’am,
better ’n I kin tell ye, how quer’ls grows. Bad
tempers&mdash;sass-hatefulness&mdash;candles hid&mdash;no
light shinin’&mdash;an’ then&mdash;blows! Yis, ma’am,&mdash;blows!”</p>

<p>“Mary Jane! Those two old men!”</p>

<p>“Nobody elset. I don’t wonder ye’re dumberfoun’,
I was myself. But fust whack I heered
out I hurried an’ there they was! Reg’lar rough
an’ tumble, right in the hay-mow, afore Teety
pony’s own eyes; an’ I declar’, if that knowin’
critter didn’t actilly ’pear ter be laughin’. An’
’shamed I am ter have lived ter this day! But&mdash;so
much fer the Methodist doctrine! No,
ma’am, nobody needn’t tell me ’at anything
short o’ full ’mersion ’ll ever wash the wickedness
out o’ poor humans like Resolved Tubbs! No,
ma’am, ye needn’t.”</p>

<p>As Madam Calthorp had never “told” anything
of the sort, she could afford to smile; and
lamentable as the silly affair was, it yet, as a
previous “quer’l” had done, served to divert the
thoughts of the family from more serious
troubles.</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Tubbs! Naughty Mr. Tubbs! You&mdash;look&mdash;so
funny!” cried Steenie, laughing.
“Did my bad, darling old Sutro-boy hurt your
lumbago?” And carried away by a mental
picture of the strange conflict, she danced about
the victim of his own valor in a manner which
provoked his smiles, even if it did his anger,
also.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well&mdash;hesh up, can’t ye? I know&mdash;I
know as well as anybody ’t I’d oughter be
ashamed; but&mdash;I&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;I got that riled
I clean fergot everything. Hm-m. The furrin’
vagabones! A tellin’&mdash;ME&mdash;’t I’d oughter go
ter work an’ do sunthin’ ter help the fambly!
’S if I wasn’t a doin’ all a mortal man could,
now! An’ a sayin’ ’t he’d show me! He’d let
ever’body know ’at where he gin his heart’s love
thar he gin his mis’able airthly possessions, as
well. He’d show! That tantalizin’ like, I felt
I’d like ter ’nihilate him. I couldn’t help it.
An’ if I did take my poor mites o’ savin’s&mdash;how
fur would it go towards keepin’ a hull fambly,
an’ heathen furriners an’ circus horses, ter boot,&mdash;I’d
like ter know?”</p>

<p>“No matter, Tubbs. I am profoundly sorry
that you should have quarrelled with anybody on
our account, least of all with a poor, dependent
old man like the caballero. I agree with Mary
Jane, that one who has enjoyed the privileges
which you have, here in the East, should have
been too wise for any such trumpery nonsense;
and I trust that you will duly apologize to Sutro
Vives, and make him forget, if it is possible, your
unkind words about his being a burden upon us.
Your zeal on our behalf is appreciated; but
please consult me before you give expression to it
in the future. Enough of this. Serve supper,
please, Mary Jane.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tubbs escaped to his own apartment, a
very astonished and self-disgusted old man. If
anybody had prophesied to him such an utter collapse
of Christian conduct, he would have scouted
the suggestion with scorn. But here was the
stubborn fact: he, Resolved Tubbs, a “perfessor
an’ a beakin light, have gone and buried my
candle under the bushel! Jest fer what?”</p>

<p>Mary Jane could have told him in one word
what it took him many hours of Bible-reading
and self-examination to find out. “Jealousy,”
Mr. Tubbs, jealousy, the meanest, most obdurate
sin that ever gets into a human soul, old or
young, to twist it out of shape.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I’m glad of that! ’Cause I’m hungry.
I always am, and I didn’t know, first off,
whether I’d ought to stay at Mrs. Courtenay’s;
but they said ‘yes,’ an’ I had a lovely time.
Papa, aren’t rooks funny? They’re English,
imported, the Judge says, and they’re dozens an’
bushels an’ more, in those splendid great trees
in the park. That’s what makes ’em call it
Rookwood. An’ now, soon’s I’ve finished, I’m
goin’ to find my poor blessed Sutro Vives. He’s
been naughty, course, same’s Mr. Resolved has.
Just like they were little boys, isn’t it? But he
mustn’t stay naughty. I couldn’t ’low that,
could I, Papa? ’Cause he’s very, very good
’most always, an’ I hope Mary Jane will give
him a nice supper. Can she, Grandmother?
’Cause it must be terr’ble to be told not to eat.
I think&mdash;I think&mdash;I could do ’most anything
else better than not eat.”</p>

<p>“I think you could, sweetheart! But hunger
at your age is both natural and desirable. You
are growing very fast. I can feel that even if I
cannot see it,” responded Mr. Calthorp, caressing
the curly head which rested for a moment against
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“And when I find Sutro, I’ll make him ’pologize
to you, Grandmother; ’cause he oughtn’t
to fight at your house, anyhow, no matter if he
does sometimes at San’ Felisa. I s’pose he’s
over his anger by this time, don’t you? I can’t
bear to see folks angry; it makes me shivery all
inside, and if he isn’t I’d rather wait.”</p>

<p>“I think you are safe, my dear; and go at once.
I would not have the poor old fellow feel himself
an intruder, now, if I could help it. I fear the
plain-spoken Tubbs was not very careful of his
remarks.”</p>

<p>Steenie departed; and it was quite lamp-lighting
time before she returned, with a very troubled
face. “I cannot find my Sutro anywhere. I’ve
looked an’ looked, an’ called&mdash;called&mdash;called&mdash;low
an’ loud&mdash;but he isn’t anywhere at all.
And his blanket that he keeps in the hay to take
his siesta on is gone, too. What do you s’pose,
Papa?”</p>

<p>“That he probably has gone somewhere to
walk off his anger and mortification; and that
he will soon be back.”</p>

<p>“It would be awful mis’able if he didn’t come
back at all, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; too miserable to contemplate for a
moment. Come, my darling, and sing to me
for a little while; then, most likely, he will
return.”</p>

<p>But, at that very moment, a solitary old man,
in curious attire, and with a gay Navajo blanket
folded over his shoulder, was making his way
through the gathering twilight toward Rookwood.
His head was bowed, and his face hidden
by his wide sombrero, and he moved slowly as one
whose footsteps are hindered by a heavy heart.</p>

<p>A pathetic figure which the growing gloom
receives and hides, the humblest, and the noblest,
perhaps, of all those whose hearts have been
touched by the love of the child Steenie, he
passes thus out of the story of her life at Old
Knollsboro.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Mr. Tubbs sat
with his spectacles
in place,
his Bible on his
knee; and Steenie,
peering in at the
kitchen-door and seeing
it otherwise deserted,
would speedily
have retreated, had
she been allowed. But
an outrageous groan from Resolved arrested her
flight, and awoke her ready sympathy.</p>

<p>“Is it so bad, poor dear? Is it worser ’n
usual?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Ah-h-h!” That sigh appeared to have
arisen in the sigher’s very feet, it was so long
drawn out and so unutterably doleful. “To think
I’d a lived ter see this day! Man an’ boy, forty
odd years, have I been uset ter settin’ beside this
very fire an’ a peroosin’ o’ Scripters by this very
winder; an’ now&mdash;My-soul-I-declare,&mdash;life
ain’t wuth livin’!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pooh! You only feel hypoey, Mary
Jane says. Try an’ not think ’bout troubles so
much, please. An’ I do think, like she does, ’at
it’s the queerest thing your hypoey comes
whenever they’s such a lot to do, isn’t it? I
know you can’t help it, an’ it must make you
feel dreadful bad not to be able to help more;
but do try an’ not mind it, there’s a dear!”</p>

<p>“I’ll try; but I ain’t the man I uset ter was.
I’ve got the neuraligy in my head, an’ the dyspepsy
in my stummick, an’ the lumbago in my back,
an’ I ain’t a good deal well. You know it, don’t ye,
Steenie? Ye’re sorry fer the old man, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Why, ye-es. But I’m lots sorrier for all the
rest of the folks. My father says it’s a’most
more than Grandmother can bear, this leaving
her old home; but <i>she</i> doesn’t go ‘Oh!’ and
‘Ah-h!’ over it. She just shuts her lips tight,
an’ goes hard to work; an’ I guess that’s what
you’d better do, dear Mr. Tubbs. It seems to
help her, an’ maybe it will you. Why, she’s
packed every one o’ her ‘precious books,’ all her
own self, without nobody touching to help her;
an’ Mary Jane says it’s the best thing she could
have done.”</p>

<p>“Some folks hain’t no fine feelin’s, Steenie.
Mary Jane hain’t,&mdash;I grieve ter say it.”</p>

<p>“What makes you, then?”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;be-cause, I tell ye! Here they
ain’t nobody payin’ no ’tention ter me; ner
thinkin’ o’ my&mdash;’motions, a tearin’ myself up by
the ruts, this ’ere way; an’ jest a goin’ on as if
this break-up wasn’t nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Well. ’Xcuse me, but I don’t see as it is to&mdash;you.
’Cause it wasn’t your house, see? An’
the little new one is cuter than cute! It’s as
cunning as a doll-house. An’ Mary Jane says,
‘Make the best on ’t, honey, an’ thank the Lord
it’s in a decent neighborhood!’ An’ I’m going
to do it. Mary Jane Tubbs is a real Christian,
my father says.”</p>

<p>“Yer ‘father says’&mdash;‘father says’&mdash;tacked
onter the end o’ every verse! Yer father don’t
know ever’thing!”</p>

<p>“He does, too, Resolved Tubbs!&mdash;Mister, I
mean. Everybody says ’at he’s the best man in
the world! He can’t see a single thing, yet he’s
going to work an’ try an’ write down, all in the
dark, all ’at he knows ’bout managing a great
rancho; an’ Judge Courtenay says ’at he’ll get
it copied out ‘fair an’ square,’ an’ then printed;
an’ the world’ll have to see that it takes ‘more ’n
blindness to kill a brave man,’&mdash;so there! And
he doesn’t groan, either. Since he’s thought
’bout this book business he’s just as jolly as he
used to be, an’ never lets Grandmother nor me
nor anybody see if he feels bad&mdash;not once!
S’posin’ he got the hypo, too! Wouldn’t Grandmother
an’ Mary Jane an’ me have a terr’ble
time, then?”</p>

<p>“Hm-m. I don’t see where Mary Jane’s sech
a great Christian! My-soul-I-declare! I hain’t
seen her tetch her Bible once sence we begun ter
tear up.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s just it! My father says
’at she has its teachings so deep down inside her
’at she can’t forget them, an’ doesn’t need to
read ’em so much. He says her keeping the
meals regular an’ well-cooked, an’ the house sun-shiny
an’ clean, an’ herself good-tempered through
all her hard work, has taught him a beautiful
lesson. Think of it! Just Mary Jane teaching
my papa! Anyhow, I love her, an’ I came to
bid her good-by. ’Cause I’m off to Rookwood
an’ lessons an’ fun, now! Where is she? Do
you know?”</p>

<p>“No, ner keer; an’ you’re a ungrateful little
girl. Thar I sot, all yisterday arternoon, a crackin’
butternuts an’ pickin’ the meats fer ye&mdash;
an’ ye never! Well, well; it’s a hard kind o’
world.”</p>

<p>“<i>Puss-ley!</i> Do shet up, an’ git up an’ take
a holt o’ some kind o’ job, brother Resolved!
You’re enough ter make a critter backslide, a
lookin’ at yer limpsey-lumpsey laziness!”</p>

<p>“Thar! Thar Steenie Calthorp! Ye hear
her? That’s yer fine Ch&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please don’t quarrel, dear folks! Don’t! An’
it isn’t so bad, is it? We’ll all be so cosey an’
cunning in the little new house. Good-by, Mary
Jane. Dear, dear Mary Jane! I love you!
You’re so lively an’ kind, an’ fly-about-y! You
make everybody feel so good, dear Mary Jane!
Good-by.”</p>

<p>At the door the child paused; her conscience
upbraided her for manifesting the partiality she
could not help feeling, and with a sudden dash
across the room, she caught Mr. Tubbs’s neck in
her arms and gave him a hearty kiss. Then she
darted out again, and in a moment was speeding
down the street toward Rookwood, where
she still went every day, but now quite
by herself. Tito had for some weeks been
domiciled in Judge Courtenay’s roomy stables,
and his little mistress saw him daily. Almost
daily, also, she had a long ride on his back, so
that she scarcely missed him from the High-Street
home; and thus one trouble which had
seemed unendurable in prospect became quite
the contrary in reality.</p>

<p>“Because, you see, Mary Jane, they isn’t any
nice cunning little barn to keep him in at the
new cottage, so I’m glad after all.”</p>

<p>“Yis, dearie; an’ so you’ll find out, long’s
you live. Trouble is a great hand ter stan’ a
ways off an’ make up faces at ye: an’ ye feel’s
if ye couldn’t endure it, no way. But jest
you pluck up spunk ever’ time, an’ march
straight up ter the old thing, and there,&mdash;lo! an’
behold!&mdash;she’s a grinnin’ an’ a smilin’ as if
she’s the best friend you’ve got. An’ most the
times she is. Folks ’at don’t have no real trouble
ter git along with, don’t gen’ally amount ter
shucks. Life ain’t all catnip; an’ it hain’t meant
ter be. An’ ye better, by far, bear the yoke in
yer youth ’an in yer old age.”</p>

<p>“Like Mr. Resolved? He’s bearing it now,
isn’t he, in his old age? Is that what you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Not by a jug-full! He ain’t a bearin’&mdash;nothin’;
he’s squat right down under it, an’ a
lettin’ it squash all the marrer o’ religion out o’
his poor old bones. Foolish brother Resolved!
I’ve be’n a bolsterin’ an’ a highsterin’ him up all
my life, an’ I ’spect I’ll have ter continner on ter
the end. No matter; I didn’t have the choosin’
o’ my own trials er I wouldn’t a chose that kind
o’ relations. An’ the good Lord is a lookin’ out
fer poor Mary Jane; so why should she bother
ter look out fer herself?”</p>

<p>Even the sorrow of losing Sutro had taken
on a softer aspect when, after his first night’s
absence, Steenie learned from Judge Courtenay
that the old caballero had been at Rookwood
just at nightfall, had remained long enough to
“transact some business” with himself, and then
had started on a late train across the continent
to Santa Felisa. The Judge had also given her
Sutro’s last loving message:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell, <i>mi niña</i>, that her love has made old
Sutro Vives a better man. That he could not
stay to be a burden to anybody; that he’ll be
well and happy in the spot where he was born;
and that he goes to make his last home on his
own property of Santa Trinidad. <i>Caramba!</i> He
will rest well, with old Californian soil for his
bed, and Californian sunshine for his blanket.
Thou wilt say to her these words, Señor Juez?”</p>

<p>When the gentleman answered warmly: “I
will do everything I can for your ‘Little Lady
of the Horse,’ Señor Vives; I will carry out your
instructions to the letter,” Sutro murmured:
“Ten thousand thanks, most generous. <i>Gracias
a Dios!</i> I shall see San’ Felis once more!” and
departed.</p>

<p>But all this was sometime past; and as Steenie
went now to Rookwood, the brilliant autumn
leaves were beginning to fade on the paths, and
the Michaelmas daisies bloomed thickly by the
roadside. She passed along, a gay, cheerful,
loving little maiden, feeling that the world held
but one trouble for her now, and that one so far
beyond her power to remove, that she was trying
to “march straight up to it,” and see if it would
smile at her, as Mary Jane had said.</p>

<p>The trouble has probably been foreseen; and
Judge Courtenay put it into words for her as she
danced up to the porch where he was pacing, and
swept him a grave, graceful Spanish “courtesy,”
that she had learned “at home” from dark-eyed
Suzan´.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, good-morning, Miss Sunbeam!
You look as bright as if we elder people were
not worrying our heads off this minute! So
when does the ‘flitting’ occur? The removal
from High Street to that miserable cottage?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, sir, thank you! An’, please
’xcuse me, but it isn’t mis’able. It’s as pretty
as it can be, I think.”</p>

<p>“And ‘I think’ settles it, eh? Well, well;
you ought to thank Heaven for your temperament!
Now if I only had it, I shouldn’t be
feeling this minute angry enough to ‘bite a ten-penny
nail in two.’”</p>

<p>Down sat the funny gentleman in the big
Plymouth rocker, and opened his arms to “his
other little girl,” who nestled in them quite as
confidently and almost as lovingly as Beatrice
would have done. “Why, sir, whatever can be
the matter to make <i>you</i>&mdash;look cross?”</p>

<p>“I look it, too, do I?&mdash;as well as feel it.
Hm-m. Thank you. Children, et cetera,&mdash;truth,
you know. First reason, please: I’m deserted.
My wife and daughter are busy with all these
guests, and I’ve had to retreat to the schoolroom
for a bit of quiet.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. They have to be p’lite, I
s’pose. My grandmother says ’at folks who live
in high stations, like you do, owes great ’sponsibilities
to s’ciety an’ its demandings.”</p>

<p>“Your grandmother is an oracle! She’s making
you one. But draw up that other chair and
hear me grumble; it does me good to express
myself to somebody. My wife says that I cannot
keep anything, save clients’ business, to myself.
Hm-m. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose she knows, prob’ly. But am I to
have no lessons?”</p>

<p>“No. Not unless you are suffering to rattle
off: ‘I have been, thou hast been or you have
been, he has been,’&mdash;and all the rest of it.
Seems to me I heard you say, yesterday, that
you thought grammar was not very ‘exciting,’
eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, sir, it isn’t! And if I could have
a holiday, maybe Diablo could have another
waltzing lesson, couldn’t he? He’s such a
graceful, teachable horse, I love him!”</p>

<p>“So do I, thanks to your wise interpretation
of his character. But Diablo isn’t in today’s
programme. And I’m greatly disturbed, absurdly
disturbed, for such a foolish cause. However, I
cannot help it, cannot throw it off.”</p>

<p>“Can I help it? I wish I could! What is
the thing ’at disturbs you?”</p>

<p>“The afternoon’s race.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what? I thought everything was all
fixed. I hope it isn’t given up, is it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. Nor do I like to postpone it;
but&mdash;There comes John with a telegram. I
hope a favorable one.”</p>

<p>The race referred to was a proposed contest for
supremacy to be held at the “private track” of
Rookwood, between the Courtenay horses and
those of neighboring county magnates. As has
been said before, that part of the state was
famous for its fine stock; and these millionnaire
owners of world-renowned animals spared no expense
in the indulgence of their equine “hobby,”
or the furtherance of their ambition to lead in
the matter of speed and purity of breed.</p>

<p>Steenie had been deeply interested in the preparations,
and her heart beat in sympathy with a
distress she had now learned was connected with
the day’s event.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! It’s too bad! Too contemptibly
pitiful and mean! I can’t get the other jockey,
either!” exclaimed the Judge, thrusting the yellow
missive behind him, and striding up and down
the school-room porch.</p>

<p>Steenie waited but a moment, then she stole to
his side, slipped her warm little hand into his
great palm, and made an absurd attempt with
her own shorter limbs to equal the pace of her
perplexed friend.</p>

<p>“Hm-m. You good little thing! But even
your encouragement can’t help me now.”</p>

<p>“Would you just as lief tell me what it is?
Maybe I could help, maybe. I’m awful anxious
to, ’cause, ’cause&mdash;you’re so good to me an’
every single body. Maybe I can.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could! If you were a boy!
Hm-m. No use. Yet it is so trying to be balked
by a little thing like that!”</p>

<p>“Like what, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you persistent little monkey! There&mdash;you
know I mean that for a compliment! Come
then, sit you down and hear an old simpleton’s
trouble, then laugh at him as you laugh at all
annoyance.”</p>

<p>“But not folks. Dear Judge Courtenay, I
don’t mean to laugh at folks.”</p>

<p>“You don’t! Listen. You know Lady Trix?”</p>

<p>“Course.”</p>

<p>“You know she’s fast, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Faster ’n lightning!”</p>

<p>“Pretty near, I declare. Well, you know,
also, that boy Tretter who was going to ride her
against Doctor Gerould’s Mordaunt?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well?”</p>

<p>“Anything but well! That imp has gone and
tumbled off a wood-shed roof, playing circus, and
broke his leg.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Poor Tretter!”</p>

<p>“Poor Tretter? Poor Courtenay! Lady Trix
was never ridden by anybody else, at any such
time as this. He was just right weight, and had
a good head,&mdash;or I thought that he had till this
performance.”</p>

<p>“But I s’pose he couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help it? What did he get up there
for, any way? I’d have given him a thousand dollars
to stay off that roof,&mdash;or at least to postpone
the leg-break for another twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Steenie gazed at her old friend’s face in astonishment;
then her own countenance flushed.
“Oh, I said maybe I could help you, and I can&mdash;I
can!”</p>

<p>“What? Do you know any jockey round
here, worth a cent? One that Trix will bear?”
asked the other, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I ain’t ’quainted with any jockeys
in Old Knollsboro; but <i>I</i>&mdash;can ride her.”</p>

<p>There was utter silence for an instant, and the
horse-fancier’s face brightened. “You?” Then
it sobered again. “Thank you, dearie, but that
wouldn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it? I’m sure I could! And
I want you to win; I do, I do! I’d be so glad!
Do let me try?”</p>

<p>“Steenie Calthorp, don’t tempt me; in a case
like this my will is water!”</p>

<p>“But why not? Don’t you know that I could?
Haven’t you seen me ride Diablo bareback,&mdash;standing&mdash;sitting&mdash;every
way? And once, before
I knew how ’ticular you were ’bout her, I
came dreadful near riding Trixie myself,&mdash;I did,
indeed, only Beatrice told me better. But I could.
Mayn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I want to win!”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Try me; please try me! You’ve done things
an’ things an’ things&mdash;for me; an’ now&mdash;please
let me do this wee, wee little thing for you.”</p>

<p>“Wee? It’s a tremendous undertaking.”</p>

<p>“Pouf!” Steenie shrugged her shoulders in
one of her little Spanish fashions, and made a
motion of blowing thistle-down from her fingertips.
“Wait till I tell you. Do sit down a
minute, please. I can ride anything. I can
ride standing, an’ jumping through rings, an’
over hurdles, an’ any way a horse can go I can
ride. If you’ll let me show you now,&mdash;once
this morning,&mdash;before everybody much is on the
track, I’ll make you see. Then you’ll say yes,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Steenie&mdash;I’m&mdash;I’m wax. But your grandmother&mdash;Do
with me as you will!” cried the
Judge, comically, but looking very much relieved.
“And there certainly is no harm in your riding
Trixie once, now&mdash;as you say.”</p>

<p>Within the next half-hour Steenie demonstrated
fully her ability to ride Lady Trix, “anyhow,
any shape,” and to that sensitive animal’s perfect
satisfaction, which, in such a case, was far
more important than the satisfaction of her
master.</p>

<p>“But, my little girl, what shall we say to the
people at home? What will they think of me
as a guardian for their jealously-loved child?”</p>

<p>Steenie sat thoughtful for a moment; then
her face cleared. “They’ll say I ought to do it
if I can,&mdash;that is, if he was here to know ’bout
it my father would say so. He tells me all the
time to show my ’preciation of your kindness;
an’ how am I going to if you don’t let me have
any chance? The only one way I can do things
for you is through your horses, ’cause I know
’bout ’em. Isn’t it? I’m puffectly sure my
father would say yes.”</p>

<p>The Judge was reasonably certain of that also;
but he was not so positive concerning Madam’s
opinion. However, his inclination urged him so
strongly that he at last replied: “Then, my brave,
helpful little girl, hear me. If I let you ride you
must take the thousand dollars I offered. Wait&mdash;listen&mdash;understand.
It is the want of just that
paltry sum which necessitates your grandmother’s
leaving her old home; she was ‘short’ just that
amount in her indebtedness, or ‘liability,’ after
the farm was sold. To raise this money she is
to sell her home. She would not accept the loan
of it, because she saw no way of ever repaying
it; and if your dear father’s writing ever comes
to anything, it will be in the future,&mdash;some
distance.”</p>

<p>“If you ride and win the race you must consider
that you earn the money fairly; and must
take it. Else&mdash;no&mdash;decidedly&mdash;to the whole
proposition.”</p>

<p>Again Steenie considered seriously. Her hesitation
was not for herself, of course, but for that
proud old lady whom she so loved and, also,
feared. “If I earned it that way it couldn’t be
wrong, could it? To keep a dear grandmother
in ‘the home of her youth.’ My father says
what we do things for, makes the things hono’ble,
or dishono’ble. That was ’bout the riding-school.
He would have let me, only he didn’t like&mdash;You
know. ’Count o’ Grandmother. This won’t
be wrong, will it?”</p>

<p>“From my point of view it seems very right,
in every way; unless you are afraid of the horse,
or the publicity.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The people,&mdash;the being stared at. Will it
make any difference with your nerves?”</p>

<p>“No! Oh, no! Grandmother says I haven’t
any nerves, she guesses. And I’m not afraid of
folks&mdash;no more than horses. Why should I be?
They’re awful nice to me. Everybody is.”</p>

<p>“How can they help being? Is it a compact,
then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes! Oh, what fun! It makes
me think of San’ Felis’ an’ my dear ‘boys,’ an’
most of all of darling Bob. He’d be proud of
the Little Un, wouldn’t he? Oh, if he only
knew!” She turned from Trixie’s stall toward
the stable door, and looked up at somebody
who stood there, the attendant groom, she had
supposed.</p>

<p>“He does, Little Un! Here he is! All the
way from Californy to see you win!”</p>

<p>“Bob! My Bob!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">What? What is
this?” Judge Courtenay
looked incredulously
around; and
there was Steenie
clasping her arms about
the neck of a tall stranger
who had knelt
upon the stable
floor, the better to
receive her caress,
and whose brown,
honest face shone with a delight which matched
her own. “Bob, is it? Why, sir, I know all
about you! And right glad I am to see you.”</p>

<p>“The same, sir. Judge Courtenay, I presume.
Just got in from the West. Hunted up the
‘boss’ first, and he shipped me on here. Knew
it wouldn’t do to keep my eyes from the sight of
this here young lady, not no longer ’n necessary,
no.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob, why didn’t you send me word so
that I could have been ’xpecting you? I’m so
glad&mdash;glad&mdash;glad!”</p>

<p>“Glad I didn’t, hey? But you’ve growed!
You’ve growed a power sence I lifted you aboard
cars at San’ Felis’ station. How’s ever’thing?”</p>

<p>“Everything? Well. No&mdash;I don’t know.
Did Sutro Vives get safely back home?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Sutry’s all right,” answered the Kentuckian,
quietly, and fixing a significant glance
upon Judge Courtenay’s face. “But let me in on
this racket. What is it? A horse-race, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’m to drive and ride this beauty.
I must win, Bob! I must. But now I know I
shall&mdash;with you on hand to ’courage me. Oh,
I’m so glad, so glad!”</p>

<p>“Give me the hull business. What’s about
this thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“Down here,&mdash;sit right down here, an’ wait
till I tell you.” Down sat the ranchman, obediently,
and Steenie close beside him, while she
poured into his ears a rapid history of what had
befallen her since her departure from her childhood’s
home.</p>

<p>Much of this he had already learned from her
letters; much more Sutro had told him; but this
last threatened calamity&mdash;the family moving on
the morrow from the old house in High Street to
the tiny cottage in the suburbs&mdash;and the privations
which menaced this child so dear to him,
was news and sad news. Still, he had come East
to put his own powerful shoulder to the burden
his beloved Little Un was so bravely trying to
lift with her own childish strength, and there
“was no such word as fail” in Kentucky Bob’s
vocabulary.</p>

<p>“Well! Where’s yer rig-out? Ain’t a goin’
to ’pear afore the assembled multitudes in just
that flimsy frock, are you,&mdash;or is it a new
style?”</p>

<p>“No! Course not. Did I ever? But I’ve
the cutest little habit ’at ever was! Grandmother
had it made for me; ’cause Mary Jane
said, ‘If I was bound ter break my neck, I’d
better break it lookin’ ’spectable.’ Oh, that
Mary Jane! She’s the dearest, best, funniest
little old body; moves all of a jerk, an’ so quick
she makes Mr. Resolved dizzy to watch her,&mdash;so
he says. He’s way down, down at the bottom
of everything, all the whole time; but he has
the lumbago, an’ it’s that I s’pose. Though
she’s his sister an’ she doesn’t get hypoey, never.
An’&mdash;oh, my habit? Why, you see, dear Bob,
when we had to sell Tito&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wh-at? Say that again. ’Pears like I don’t
understand very sharp.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you ’bout that? But it was so.
We couldn’t ’ford to keep him, my grandmother
says; an’ Judge Courtenay bought him; an’ Papa
put the money in the savings bank toward my
education, ’cause he said it was a’most like takin’
money for folks, an’ it shouldn’t be used ’cept for
the best purpose. And dear Mrs. Courtenay
made me bring my habit an’ keep it here; so’s
when I’ve done my lessons extra well I can have
a ride on Tito for a ‘reward.’ Anyhow, I see
him every day; an’ I’ve ’xplained it to him best
I could; but he doesn’t understand it very well,
I think. Any way he doesn’t behave real nice.
When I go away he whinnies an’ cries an’ acts&mdash;he
acts quite naughty, sometimes. But he
oughtn’t; for everybody is as good as good to
him. Come and see him this minute.”</p>

<p>Away went the reunited friends, and Tito’s
intelligent eyes lighted with almost human joy
when his kind old instructor laid a caressing
hand upon his head, and cried out gayly:
“Howdy, old boy! Shake, my hearty, shake!”</p>

<p>Up went Tito’s graceful fore-leg, and “shake”
it was, literally and emphatically. When this
ceremony was over and the magnificent stables
of Rookwood had been duly examined and admired,
Steenie was commissioned to bring her
friend into dinner, which was early that day on
account of the afternoon’s arrangements. During
its progress, Bob managed to give considerable
information concerning Santa Felisa happenings,
as well as dispose of a hearty meal. He had
“begged off” from going to table with “these
high-toned Easteners; ’cause you know, Little Un,
’t I never et to no comp’ny table nowheres,&mdash;not
even to your’n an’ your pa’s. I’m a free-born
American, an’ all that rubbish&mdash;but I know
what’s what: the more for that reason. In&mdash;my
place I’m as good as the next feller an’-a-little-better-too-sir;
but outen it&mdash;I’m outen it.
Them ’at rides the plains an’ looks arter stawk,
as I’ve done the last hunderd years, more or
less, hain’t learned to dip their fingers into no
fingerbowls nor wipe their mustache on no fringed
napkins.”</p>

<p>But Judge Courtenay overruled the stranger’s
objections, and once having accepted the situation,
Bob made the best of it. He was awkward,
of course, and ignorant concerning table etiquette;
but he let his awkwardness apologize for itself by
his simple good nature in the matter; and if his
talk was not polished, it was full of wit, originality,
and a verve that carried his listeners
captive.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Mrs. Courtenay, when at last
they could no longer delay their rising from the
board, “I do not know when I have enjoyed
anything so much as your descriptions of ranch-life.
It is almost as good as seeing it for myself;
and it gives me a real longing for its breeziness
and freedom from social cares and restrictions.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only life worth livin’, ma’am, in my
opinion. Which same I don’t go for to set up
ag’in that of any other man or woman, only for
myself. I&mdash;I couldn’t exist anywheres elst,
for any great length o’ time. I don’t want
nothin’ less ’an a ten-mile field to swing my long
arms round in. There ain’t&mdash;But, what’s the
use? If I talked all day I couldn’t tell nobody
what them big open spaces o’ airth an’ sky is to
me; an’ if they’s a good Lord anywheres about,
He’s out there in them blossomin’ plains an’
snow-capped mountains an’ etarnal sunshine.”</p>

<p>“My old Marm uset ter sing ’bout the ‘Beautiful
Heaven above,’ an’ ’pear to enjoy thinkin’ on
’t; an’ once I ast her what she ’lowed it was like.
She said if ’t was like anything she knowed, she’d
ruther it’d be like Salem village,&mdash;out hum
in the State o’ Massachusetts,&mdash;an’ ary other
place she’d ever seen. But I don’t want no villages
in mine; an’ if ever I git thar I don’t ask
no purtier place ’an Californy to go ridin’ round
in, forever an’ ever. Amen.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Well, to most of us, probably, Heaven
is typical of what we like best,” said the Judge,
gravely, and led the way library-ward. Where,
for a while, he held a most absorbing conversation
with this stranger from the West; and
when it was ended his genial countenance was
even more serious than before.</p>

<p>Then came the shouts of the children, eager
to be off to the “course;” and thither, presently,
everybody repaired.</p>

<p>“Well, Little Un, you look prime! Bless my
eyes! ’Pears ye’ve growed more ’n five months’
wuth, in these five months o’ time, long as they
has be’n to old Bob, without ye. An’, huckleberries!
They is quite a crowd around, ain’t
they! Well, you don’t mind that none, do
ye?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not; an’, Bob, let me tell
you, you stand in some certain place,&mdash;you pick
out where,&mdash;an’ every time I go round I’ll look
at you, see? Then you can make all the old
signs you used to make, an’ it’ll be a’most as
good as Santa Felisa. But, think of it! A
thousand dollars! I want to win just as much.
I truly do. Don’t I? If only for Judge Courtenay’s
sake, ’cause he’s so dear an’ kind, an’ he’s
Beatrice’s papa,&mdash;an’ I love her so very, very
much. But most of all, now&mdash;an’ it grows
more an’ more so&mdash;I wish to get that money so
my darling old grandmother won’t have to leave
her own home an’ her pretty library, nor anything.
Oh, do you think I’ll do it?”</p>

<p>“Sartain. Sartain as I live. But you an’
I’ve got a job to tackle arterwards. Look at
these horses round here! Did ye ever see sech
a lot o’ poor, tortured, mis’able critters? Look
at that check-strap yonder! The man ’at owns
the poor thing ’pears quite peart an’ quality-like,
but he’s a fool all the same. Wish I could hitch
a string to his front lock o’ hair an’ yank his
idiotic old head over back’ards, same way! Bet
he wouldn’t go trot, trot, round that peaceable.
No, siree, he’d yell like a painter, an’ smash
things if he couldn’t get loose. An’ that other
nincompoop further down that way, see that
breechin’ he’s put on his horse? He’d oughter
be shot, ’cause big’s the world is thar ain’t room
enough in it for sech idiots as him! If I was
that horse I’d set right down on that strap an’
go to sleep, I would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear old scolder! You’ll see lots o’
cruelty to horses here in Old Knollsboro; but
the folks don’t understand ’em as well as you an’
I do. That’s the reason. My father says it
isn’t ’tentional unkindness, it’s only ignorance.
Ah! There they are calling me. Come!”</p>

<p>The news had spread that Judge Courtenay
had found a jockey to ride his Trix, and one who
was to drive her in the trainer’s place; so the
spirit of his wealthy opponent sank a little.
However, an untried, unpractised assistant, as
this new hand must be, was quite as liable to
lose as win the contest for his employer, even
though the animal he rode was unequalled for
speed. This second thought sent a thrill of satisfaction
to the heart of Doctor Gerould, the master
of Rookwood’s rival, and he now felt confident
of his own success. Like his friend, the Judge,
he was warmly enthusiastic over his “hobby,”
and would, in the height of his excitement, have
gone to any honest length to carry off that day’s
laurels.</p>

<p>But when, after some preliminary contests
between inferior beasts, the real one began, and
the four thoroughbreds who were to compete for
the famous “Rookwood cup” were drawn into
line at the starting place, he saw the girlish little
figure which was lifted into the sulky behind
Trixie, his courage ebbed again.</p>

<p>“That child! Why how in the world did
he obtain her family’s consent!” exclaimed a
neighbor.</p>

<p>“No matter how; there she is.”</p>

<p>“But, have confidence, sir. She’s only a girl.
She cannot have the wisdom and skill&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cannot she? Maybe you haven’t heard
about her; though, wasn’t it yourself expatiating
upon her wonderful riding over our country-roads
on her piebald mount? Why, man alive,
the child’s a witch! So they claim; and&mdash;Jupiter!
If they haven’t imported a regular
‘Wild Westerner’ besides! Well, I might as
well give it up. Mordaunt’s beaten.”</p>

<p>Kentucky Bob was moving about Trixie as
she stood waiting, examining every strap and
buckle of the light harness she wore, testing
its strength and that of the skeleton-like vehicle
in which he had placed his beloved “Little
Lady of the Horse.” His gaunt face was grave
and anxious. He did not like this experimenting
with untried animals, and at such a stake.
Still, he knew the mettle of the driver if
not the steed, and his superstitious faith in
Steenie’s ability to succeed everywhere and in
everything made his words cheerful, if not his
heart wholly so.</p>

<p>“I come jest in time, didn’t I, Little Un?
An’ don’t you get excited an’ ferget. You take
the outside. Thar ain’t no legs in this show ’cept
Trixie’s an’ that Mordaunt’s thar. Them two
other critters’ll drop out in no time; then you
jest keep a steady head&mdash;an’ hand&mdash;<i>an’ the outside</i>!
Don’t you ferget it. I ain’t a goin’ to have
ye crowded up ag’in no railin’ an’ so caught an’
beat&mdash;mebbe hurt. Keep to the outside, though
they be so p’lite as ter offer ye the inside show.
Steady, is the word. Go it slow&mdash;warm her
up&mdash;put on steam&mdash;get in ahead. Thar ye
go! Californy to win!”</p>

<p>But not so easily. It was a contest hardly,
barely won. Yet it was won&mdash;and honestly;
and, the driving over, Steenie was swung to the
ground once more by her attentive Bob, who
was far more pleased and proud than she.</p>

<p>“Ye did it, Little Un! Ye did it! Though,
o’ course, I didn’t expect nothin’ else o’ my
‘Mascot’!”</p>

<p>But the child’s face was downcast. The cheers
and plaudits which followed her as she went into
the waiting-room were almost unheard and quite
unnoticed, and she bounded toward Judge Courtenay
with actual tears of vexation in her blue
eyes. “Oh, I’m so sorry! You’ll never have
any faith in me again, will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear little girl! You’ve won!
Didn’t you know that you had won?” cried
the master of Rookwood, in high delight.</p>

<p>“Call it ‘won,’ sir? That little bit o’ ways?
Trixie should have been in a dozen lengths ahead,
’stead of just a teeny, tiny bit! I’m so sorry,
so sorry!”</p>

<p>That was the only way in which she could be
induced to regard her victory; but when, later
on, the riding was announced, her vivacity and
hopefulness returned. “Now&mdash;I’m all right!
I can ride&mdash;anything! Same’s I can breathe,
just as easy. An’ see here, my Lady Trix, you
have got to ’xert yourself this time, you dear,
beautiful, lazy thing! You hear? If you don’t,
I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live!
So there, my dainty one!”</p>

<p>Whether Trixie understood, who can tell?
Certainly the dire calamity her small friend
threatened was not destined to befall the proud
queen of Judge Courtenay’s stables. Maybe
because riding was, as Steenie said, more natural
to her than driving, it was evident from the word
“Go!” that she was the winner by long odds.</p>

<p>Almost it seemed, toward the last, that there
was practically no contest at all; but the truth
was that such wonderful equestrianship as
Steenie Calthorp accomplished that day had
never been seen on that or any other course
thereabouts.</p>

<p>“I’m bound to beat!&mdash;and beat so far that
I’ll feel all nice and clean about it in my heart,
too!” she declared at starting; then she kissed
her hand to Beatrice, watching wide-eyed from
a seat of honor, and rode gayly away to victory.
With her little face smiling and rosy, yet tremendously
in earnest, the far-away look in the
bonny eyes, the aureole of sun-kissed ringlets
streaming on the air, she seemed to communicate
to her mount her very thoughts and feelings,&mdash;“For
Grandmother and Home!”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>She kissed her hand to Beatrice&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page 261.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It was love, then, that won!&mdash;love and unselfishness,
which even in the person of a little
child were irresistible, as they are always irresistible.
And so well she did her part, so noble
was her aim, that, now he had learned it, even
Doctor Gerould lost every opposing wish.</p>

<p>“Well! well! If that’s the case, I’d rather
she’d beat than not&mdash;of course!&mdash;even if it
damages Mordaunt’s record. And I’ll double
the price if they’ll let me.”</p>

<p>“But, of course, also, that can’t be, my friend,”
explained the Judge. “It’s just as probable as
not that the Calthorp pride will up and make a
rumpus about the whole matter, even now. I
shall feel more comfortable after I know how
the check is received. But if anything was
ever honestly earned that was!&mdash;and never
did I draw one so willingly. There they go!
Good luck go with them!”</p>

<p>There they went, indeed! Riding in state
through the streets of Old Knollsboro, in the
Courtenay carriage, with the Courtenay livery
on the box, and crowds of admiring people, returning
village-ward, watching their progress.
Straight from love’s triumph to the square white
house in High Street, and to the brilliant smile
of the polished old “lion” on its door, a smile
of welcome Steenie had long since learned to
regard it.</p>

<p>Grandmother Calthorp, sitting sadly at the
window of her beloved and now denuded library,
saw this royal approach, and wondered. Then
her heart chilled with fear lest harm had befallen
the child who had grown into its very
depths, and had now become the centre of life to
it, dearer than any other living creature, dearer
even than the precious packed-away books which
had for so long outranked humanity in the
Madam’s estimation.</p>

<p>But Steenie was not hurt! A second glance
showed that; for through the hastily-donned
eye-glasses the waiting woman saw that the
child had risen in her place, and stood waving
joyously above her head a tiny strip of paper,
while the sparkling little face proclaimed in
advance: “Good news!”</p>

<p>Then the carriage stopped; and, although the
bearer of the paper longed to jump out, she restrained
herself till the footman had opened the
cumbrous door which stayed her impatient feet.
Then, out upon the ground and up the path
she sped, scarcely touching the ground in her
eagerness.</p>

<p>A noisy entrance, truly, but who could help
that, or who reprove?</p>

<p>“Grandmother! See here! See here! You
needn’t move! Never&mdash;never&mdash;never! A
thousand dollars! A whole one thousand splendid
dollars! I earned it! I won the race! For
you&mdash;for you!”</p>

<p>Then the white paper fluttered into the trembling
old hands; and Steenie’s dancing feet bore
her swiftly from the room to find and share with
the proud father her happy news.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>RESOLVED AND MARY JANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Land o’ Goshen!
Madam’s a
cryin’!” Mary
Jane had rubbed
her eyes repeatedly,
believing
they deceived
her; but she was
now forced to admit
the truth of
their report.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no sech a thing!” retorted Resolved,
testily. Yet he advanced to peep over his sister’s
shoulder at this startling phenomenon; then
he pushed his spectacles up out of place, the
better to “see with his own eyes” this unprecedented
proceeding, and ejaculated: “My-soul-I-declare!”</p>

<p>This was what he beheld.</p>

<p>Daniel Calthorp sitting near the window, leaning
his brow upon his hand, not indeed to veil
his sightless eyes from any untoward spectacle,
but to hide the workings of his own face.</p>

<p>Kentucky Bob standing in the doorway, uneasily
shifting his great length from foot to foot,
and ready for flight the instant things became
“a trifle too tropercal fer a Westerner.”</p>

<p>While Steenie was kneeling before the Madam’s
chair, her warm little hands resting upon the
worn white hands in the lady’s lap, and her eager,
loving glances trying to interpret the conflicting
emotions which pictured themselves upon the
noble face above her.</p>

<p>The worst sign of all, in Mary Jane’s opinion,
was that her proud mistress evidently didn’t even
care how many witnessed this unusual display of
weakness. “She ain’t a tryin’ ter hide nothin’!
Not a tear! Poor soul, poor soul! She’s a down
deep in the waters o’ triberlation when she lets
go o’ her hefty sperrit, an’ don’t mind us a seein’
what we do now. That ever I should a lived ter
look at Madam Calthorp a weepin’ tears! Oh,
my soul, oh! I did think ’at we’d manage ter
go out the old house, as Steenie says, ‘colors
flyin’’ an’ hearts braced up, even if bust. But
when she&mdash;<i>she</i>&mdash;gins out, let us <i>all</i> gin out.
Oh, me&mdash;me!”</p>

<p>“Shat up carn’t ye? Hark! What’s the
youngun a sayin’?”</p>

<p>Curiosity comforted the faithful old serving-woman’s
immediate grief; she paused in the
very middle of a sigh to listen.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so, dear grandmother, darling
grandmother! Did I do so very, very wrong?
Do b’lieve me, I didn’t mean to. An’&mdash;my!
Wait, Grandmother! If you don’t want it, please
don’t cry on poor Judge Courtenay’s check, ’cause
Papa says&mdash;Oh, Grandmother! Will you?
Will you?”</p>

<p>The pantomime was more intelligible than the
words. For the first time the stately head was
bent slightly,&mdash;even under the relaxation of these
unprecedented circumstances it had been held upright,&mdash;and
a sudden smile broke over the tear-wet
face, making it beautiful as proud.</p>

<p>Proud it had always been, but not as now,
proud with an unutterable tenderness, proud&mdash;even
that paradox&mdash;in a new, sweet, and reverent
humility, as the thin hands gently dropped
upon the child’s curly head, and the tremulous
lips found voice: “Steenie, Steenie! My brave,
precious one! Hush! There is no reproach for
you; there is nothing but love and obligation.
You have humbled me as I have never been humbled
in my life; and you have made me proud
as I have never been proud. You have conquered
your grandmother, now come to her.”</p>

<p>Steenie leaped, joyfully, into the arms opened
to receive her, but the words which had fallen
from the Madam’s lips mystified her, and she
was still clinging about the speaker’s shoulders,
looking doubtfully upon the narrow white check,
which had fallen to the carpetless floor, when
Bob’s resonant voice cut into a scene which was
becoming “too all-fired watery round the eyes
for him,” and cleared the mystery.</p>

<p>“Which means, my Little Un, begging your
pardon, Ma’am, an’ everybody’s pardon, that our
‘Little Lady of the Horse’ hain’t won her ticket
for nothin’. Which bein’ the case&mdash;I say, old
feller? You Unresolved old Puritan, you, I think
I know a cure for your lumbago. Want to hear
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answered Mr. Tubbs, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Here ’tis. Price nothin’. Turn to an’ fetch
a hammer an’ nails, an’ unroll that strip o’ carpet
thar. I don’t relish the sound o’ my own boots
on hard oak floors like this un, an’ the sooner we
get the carpet back into place, the sooner I shall
feel to hum. Lively, now. We’ll get it down afore
pitch-dark, even in this region o’ short days.”</p>

<p>To picture Mr. Tubbs’s disgust is impossible.
Then, even to his selfish heart, crept a warm,
tender, human feeling, and he cast a sidelong
glance at the mistress he had served so long,
if not so well.</p>

<p>Observing which, Bob, that clear-sighted translator
of people’s emotions, gave friendly encouragement.
“That’s the fust step. Second&mdash;look!
See here? Look at this vial? Know what it
is? Ever see anything so fine?”</p>

<p>“Eh? No. What is it?” demanded Resolved,
who had a keen eye and ear for anything
in the shape of “medicine.”</p>

<p>“Rattlesnake ile,&mdash;that’s what she is. Double
distilled, an’ forty-thousandth purity. Volatile
as gas. Can’t fix it in no ordinary bottles,
with no ordinary stoppers. Worth its weight in
gold; worth more if it couldn’t be replaced.
Sample I brought from my Little Un’s property,&mdash;from
the rancho er the mountain o’ Santa
Trinidad. Hm! Didn’t mean to say that&mdash;yet.
But no matter. Step lively now. An’ if ye
do, I’ll rub some o’ this precious stuff on your
worthless old back, an’ if I don’t bounce the
lumbago, my name ain’t Bob, an’ I hain’t never
rid on no Santa Felisa round-up.”</p>

<p>There was tonic, elixir, in the very tone; not
only for the stiff-jointed Mr. Tubbs, but for every
individual there present.</p>

<p>Mary Jane, proper Baptist that she was, almost
executed a fancy dance; but recollecting herself
in time, went hurrying away to her kitchen, her
cracked, quavering, but joyful voice proclaiming
in song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve reached a land of corn and wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all its riches freely mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here shines undimmed one blissful day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For all my night has passed away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Calthorp crossed over and gave his mother
a grateful kiss, then walked out whistling.</p>

<p>Steenie slipped down and watched her grandmother
fold the beneficent scrap of white paper
safely away in her pocket-book, then danced a
<i>pas-de-seul</i> without any of Mary Jane’s scruples
of conscience.</p>

<p>And even Madam Calthorp began humming
softly some melody of her youth, and moved the
chairs out of the room, to further the cheerful
labor of Kentucky Bob, who had the carpet
unrolled and into place, “in the jerk of a lamb’s
tail,” and who whistled gayly, till he remembered
that he was the guest of a high-bred lady,
when he restrained himself, and worked away all
the faster, maybe.</p>

<p>“My, isn’t it just too delightful to be happy!”
cried small Steenie, in the fulness of her rapture;
and the instant laugh which greeted her quaint
exclamation was answer sufficient.</p>

<p>“It’s taken ferever ter git these things tore
up an’ out o’ place; but I guess they’ll ’bout fly
back inter it ag’in, o’ their own accord,” said Mary
Jane, unwrapping the parlor “table-spread” and
recklessly throwing away the string. While Resolved
puffed and stretched at that carpet, determined
to keep ahead of Bob’s resolute, speedy
“tack,” “tack,” without one grunt or groan.</p>

<p>Wasn’t it fun to put that old house “to
rights” once more? Wasn’t it? Such fun that,
as Mary Jane prophesied, the furniture almost
seemed to march itself back into position; while
Steenie was allowed, not only to handle, but to
unpack and restore to their own shelves the precious
books which seemed “folks a’most” to their
loving owner.</p>

<p>But to all sunshine there is shadow. To the
brightest day succeeds a twilight; and a spiritual
twilight fell upon these happy people, when, after
all was done that could be done, they gathered
about the blazing fire on the great hearth-stone
in the dining-room, and heard the story which
Kentucky Bob had come so far to tell.</p>

<p>“’Pears as if I didn’t know how to begin it.
But I must; though I ain’t no oraytor, I ain’t.
Come a here, Little Un. The ‘boss’ won’t mind
a sparin’ of ye to me I ’low, an’ mebbe I kin talk
straighter a feelin’ yer little hand in mine. Good
little hand, strong little hand, lovin’ little hand,
that takes right a holt o’ everybody’s heart an’
pulls it out o’ wickedness an’ inter the straight.
Pulled old Sutry Vives out o’ malice an’ murder,
ter live a Christian an’ die a martyr.”</p>

<p>“What? <i>What?</i>” cried Steenie, aghast.</p>

<p>“Hush, Little Un, don’t! It’s ’bout all old
Bob kin do, anyhow&mdash;an’&mdash;Don’t make a
break in the perceedin’s ag’in, if ye kin help it,
don’t! ’Cause I ain’t much uset ter preachin’,
an’ this here&mdash;is <i>’bout</i> a&mdash;<i>funeral sermon</i>!”</p>

<p>He needed not to hush any one again, not even
when the “sermon” was ended.</p>

<p>“Sutry, he come hum. When he come I happened
ter meet him, an’ when he stepped out o’
the car at San’ Felis’ I didn’t scurcely know him.
Some o’ his folks lived above a hunderd; but
couldn’t none on ’em ever looked so old as Sutry
did that day. An’ when I spoke to him an’ told
him ‘Howdy!’ he jest stared up inter my face&mdash;No
matter! He’s square; squarest man I ever
knowed.</p>

<p>“He told me ’t he’d made his will. He’d gin
ever’thing he got ter the Little Un. ‘Everything
you’ve got?’ says I, laughin’, harsh like.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, La Trinidad.’</p>

<p>“Then I laughed more, but&mdash;not long. That
night he ast me ter take a couple o’ the boys, an’
go up inter that snake-infested peak with him.
We didn’t wanter. Snakes hadn’t be’n troublesome
none, ’long back; but, somehow, thar
warn’t no refusin’, he looked that queer an’
un-Sutry like. So next mornin’ we went; an’
goin’ up he told me all the bad news ’bout you
all, an’ his way o’ changin’ it inter good. He’d
foond out, he thought, ’at Steenie here couldn’t
’herit till he was dead. He could gin her anything
he’d a mind to; but he knowed nobody
wouldn’t b’lieve none o’ his big talk, long as he
lived. But if it was her ’n, out an’ out, they’d
have ter try an’ see what this ’heritance was.
He kinder impressed me even then; an’ we went
on quite chipper. Killed a few rattlers by the
way, an’ went spang up an’ up, an’ then down
ag’in, inter the very heart o’ the mountain.
Then I seed thar’d be’n some prospectin’ done
thar sometime. We found a trail an’ we follered
it.</p>

<p>“An’ I ain’t never laughed at Sutry Vives, ner
La Trinidad property&mdash;sence. What he showed
us was enough ter sober a drunken man arter a
big spree.</p>

<p>“Then we started hum ag’in; but, half-way
down, Sutry called us ter stop.</p>

<p>“‘Boys,’ says he, ‘ye’ve seen what I showed
ye. I picked you three out, ’cause you love the
Little Un, an’ I kin trest ye. Sw’ar ’at you’ll
be true ter yer trest; sw’ar ter do the plumb
square by the little Seenoreety.’</p>

<p>“You bet we swore!&mdash;all an’ more’n he ast
us. Then we went on ag’in, but Sutry didn’t
foller.</p>

<p>“‘I feel like I’d like ter stay here a little
while alone,’ says he; ’an’ if I don’t come
down in fair season, you kin come an’ hunt me
up.’</p>

<p>“‘Better not,’ says I. But he would; an’ we,
each on us, had our dooty ter do, an’ so we left
him.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken, at last, by
Steenie, asking softly: “Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, when I rec’lect that night&mdash;I&mdash;Huckleberries!
Carn’t ye guess it? Think o’
the squarest thing a feller could do, an’ then
know he done it,&mdash;that poor, laughed-at, despised,
weak-witted old Don Sutry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me, Bob, please! My heart’s all
suffocky, an’ I can’t breathe!”</p>

<p>“You ’low I couldn’t rest. I kep’ a thinkin’
o’ that old vener’ble up thar, a takin’ his last
look at a property ’at had be’n his ’n, er his
folks, sence way back&mdash;an’ the lonesomeness
an’ all&mdash;an’ I couldn’t stan’ it. So I started
just arter moon-rise, an’ clumb up ag’in, callin’
myself names all the time fer a fool. An’ when
I got to the very heart o’ the place&mdash;thar he
lay, sleepin’ quiet an’ a’most a smilin’,&mdash;right
thar in that den!”</p>

<p>“But you waked him up, Bob? Quick&mdash;didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. Perhaps I had a job, though!
’Twas a close call fer the old caballero. An’
when I’d rousted him a little, ye should a heered
him pitch inter me! ’Cause I wouldn’t let him
lay still thar an’ die o’ rattlesnake bite!”</p>

<p>“Why, Bob? Why should he wish to die?”</p>

<p>“Fer your sake, Little Un; to make you
rich an’ happy an’ ever’thing. An’ I ’low the
notion was jest as noble as if he’d be’n let ter
finish it up as he meant.”</p>

<p>“Well? The result?” asked Mr. Calthorp,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll live, I reckin; but his old age
won’t be not very flourishin’ ner green-bay-tree
like. ’Twas an even chance, ’bout. I carried
him down on my back, an’ thar happened ter be
an old Indian on hand ’at done his level best;
an’ he’ll live. So they think.</p>

<p>“But we had a tussle with him, fust. An’ not
till Lord Plunkett himself, who had come round
that way ag’in, was lugged inter the room ter
hear the hull story, an’ ter promise ever’thing
should be done same as if he died, would
Sutry consent ter take the stuff old Pueblo
forced down his throat. But, to all intents
an’ purposes, he was a martyr, Sutry Vives
was.”</p>

<p>The graphic story cast over them all an awed
and solemn feeling which made speech seem
impossible. Till, after awhile, a half-charred
stick fell into the coals, and Mary Jane looked
up through her tears. “Greater love hath no
man than this,” said she, softly; and even
Resolved failed to sniff.</p>

<p>Finally Madam Calthorp asked: “What was
in the mountain that made it so valuable in the
old Spaniard’s eyes?”</p>

<p>“Sunthin’, ’at when it’s developed&mdash;as Lord
Plunkett an’ Jedge Courtenay has offered ter
advance the funds fer&mdash;’ill make the Little
Un rich enough ter kindle fires with jest sech
checks as she fetched home ter-day.”</p>

<p>“But I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Silver, ma’am, silver. Quality, A one.
Quantity, unlimited. That’s all it was.”</p>

<p>It is very artistically illustrated by Victor A. Searles, and is
handsomely printed and bound. The chief characters are
members of a Quaker family. The young hero and heroine,
through misfortune, show a readiness to make the best
of things, he by diligent application, and she by meeting
everything with a happy disposition, which is both entertaining
and must encourage other youngsters who read their
adventures to earnest deeds. There are many exciting incidents
and surprises in the story, which is told with exceeding
grace and brightness. It should be a very popular
Christmas gift book.&mdash;<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>It tells of the successful scheme of two bright children
to raise mushrooms, and of the way they finally lifted the
cloud of debt that rested on their home. The story is full
of good moral lessons, imparted in such a way that they do not hurt the
interest. The book is finely illustrated.&mdash;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the most delightful stories for young readers that have been published
for many years was the book given to them two years ago, entitled
“The Little Lady of the Horse,” written by Evelyn Raymond. It has already
become a classic. But the same gifted author has well matched this favorite
story with a new one which she has produced for the present holiday season,
entitled “A Cape May Diamond.” The heroine of this story was cast upon
the beach at Cape May in a basket, made waterproof, when little more than an
infant, and was adopted by a worthy German and his wife. She was called a
Diamond by the life-saving men because she was found in the sand, and she
grew to girlhood a universal favorite on the beach, because of her splendid
character. She was healthy, true as steel, ready to help anybody in need, and
as brave as the most faithful dog. Every reader is sure to love the sunny-hearted
little Karen, and will rejoice in the happy solution of the mystery
that surrounded her parentage and her advent at Cape May. The book is
finely illustrated by Lilian Crawford True, and it will be sure to be a holiday
favorite.</p>

land is induced by a fairy to ride away with her on the back of a salamander,
which rushes rapidly through the air until it reaches the fairies’ castle on a
floating mountain. Here silver and other metal and precious stones grow on
trees in abundance. While here, the floating mountain falls into the sea,
leaving the prince and the fairy on the salamander’s back. The fairy is disenchanted,
and in her place is a little girl who is greatly troubled because she has
forgotten the word which formerly gave her command of the salamander.
They decide to try to find the Keeper of the Salamander’s Order that they may
discover the lost word. They are whirled away and meet with strange experiences,
visiting The Largest Meteor Unknown to Science, The Island of the
Smoke Bird, The Land of the Pillow-Heads, The Some Other Kind of People,
and many strange and wonderful places, where they make friends of the queer
inhabitants. The book is well printed and handsomely bound, and contains
many appropriate illustrations. This volume will be very acceptable to young
people as a Christmas gift.&mdash;<i>Portland Press.</i></p>

<p>The narrative is quite unique in its conception, and the underlying motive
is ingeniously carried out.... The story abounds in incidents of a sufficiently
thrilling nature, is free from anything likely to wound the tender susceptibilities
of sensitive children, and it is very attractively and lavishly illustrated.&mdash;<i>The
Beacon.</i></p>

<p>One of the largest and handsomest of the books for the young that have
made their appearance this year.... The tale itself is of the fairy-like order
which always enchains the minds of the young, and which are read with relish
by their fathers and mothers. It is sufficiently extravagant in its imaginative
features to satisfy the taste of the most exacting.... It is well written.&mdash;<i>Kansas
City Herald.</i></p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
